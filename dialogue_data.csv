"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""Hi! How are you doing tonight?""
B: ""I'm doing great. Just relaxing with my two dogs.""
A: ""Great. In my spare time I do volunteer work.""
B: ""That's neat. What kind of volunteer work do you do?""
A: ""I work in a homeless shelter in my town.""
B: ""Good for you. Do you like vintage cars? I've two older mustangs.""
A: ""Cool. Not really into cars. My day job is wrestling.""
B: ""Cars are my thing. Vintage cars. I love working on them. Wrestling? Do you enjoy it?""
A: ""Yes, I love the crowds, getting to know people.""
B: ""I didn't think about the crowd aspect of wrestling. I do not like crowds.""
A: ""Understood. When I need to be alone, I work out a few times each week.""
B: ""I agree. Working out is a great way to burn off steam. Do you like country music?""
A: ""A little bit. I can get into taylor swift.""
B: ""Lol. She's more pop now. Her old stuff was country. I like classic country.""
A: ""What kind of dogs do you have?""
B: ""One is a terrier and one is a sheep dog.   How long have you been volunteering?""
A: ""I have been volunteering for last 7 years""
B: ""Nice.  I try to, but I've been working on the two Mustangs.  One is a 68 and the other is a 66 Hertz clone.""
A: ""What are doing with those two?""
B: ""The 68 is a daily driver, at least during the summer.  The Hertz clone is a trailer queen.  I'm too afraid of paying for on  the road insurance.   ""
A: ""How long have you been doing this?""
B: ""Ummmm, off and on, since 1989.  It's a hobby that takes a lot of devotion.  It can be expensive, but it doesn't always have to be.""
A: ""This sounds fun. Do you have any other hobby?""
B: ""Well I do like to listen to classic country, and I do have my two dogs, ""Baron Zemo"" and ""Spike.""   What about you, how do you like wrestling as your day job?""
A: ""I'm not super into wrestling. ""
B: ""Ah, now that makes sense.  I guess it's like an engineer that doesn't like to fix stuff around the house.  Well, work is work, I guess.""
A: ""How's work on the Mustang coming?""
B: ""Not so good, I got bit by one of my dogs and needed stiches in my hand so haven't been able to make much progress.""
A: ""I'm so sorry to hear that! How on earth did that happen?""
B: ""Just a little rough housing that went a bit too far.  ""
A: ""That's unfortunate. I'm hoping you'll make a speedy recovery! What's your day job?""
B: ""I'm a dog trainer!  I guess I'm not that good""
A: ""Haha well I suppose no one is perfect. Given my recent string of lost matches, I can't say I'm doing much better.""
B: ""Yeah between the both of us, could probably get a country song written about our distresses...perhaps Taylor Swift could perform it.""
A: ""That would be a chart-topper, I'm sure. Something to blast while driving with the top down, maybe even in your next restoration project.""
B: ""Yes!! Can't wait to get back in the saddle with the restoration.  One of the one's I am working on is a convertible.""
A: ""Sweet! I'm sure that will be an amazing ride once it's finished. How long does a project take to complete, generally speaking?""
B: ""For me, I can usually do a full restoration in 6 months if I put in a few hours a day after work.""
A: ""Did you take your dogs out for a walk today?""
B: ""Yes! Thankfully there was enough of a break in the rain to run them around. How's your day been?""
A: ""It has been busy! I volunteered at the homeless shelter this morning. Do you do any volunteering? ""
B: ""Sadly not. I admire those who do though! Work keeps me so busy, and then I spent time on my car to relax. How did you get into wrestling as a job?""
A: ""I work out a few times a week and a trainer came over and asked if I was interested in wrestling and gave it a go! Have you ever wrestled? ""
B: ""No I haven't, I think I'd be terrible at it! Does it take you a long time to recover? It looks so physical and exhuasting!""
A: ""No different in my opinion then working out at the gym, keeps your mind focused! You should try it sometime, I think you would like wrestling!""
B: ""I can definitely see how it would be cathartic, although I'm so worried about getting my ass whooped I'm sure I'd be terrible. But it's all about working up a sweat, right?""
A: ""Yes, getting beat is not a highlight but makes you want to train even harder! And working up a sweat is no joke! Ha ha. ""
B: ""I definitely respect the mental stamina needed, too. I could learn some more of that, sometimes working on my car gets me so frustrated I can't stand it, ha!""
A: ""I can see that. I have attempted to work on cars, I don't have the patience for it! I need to keep moving!""
B: ""It's definitely an acquired thing. The word needs mechanics and wrestlers, ha!""

"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""Hello, how are you doing?""
B: ""I love spending time with my family""
A: ""That is great, me too! I'm married and my husband and I've 2 children.""
B: ""So then have you ever been to disneyland?""
A: ""No, we recently purchased a new house, so we cannot afford it. Have you?""
B: ""Yes I love mickey mouse such a cute little rat""
A: ""I enjoy going to concerts, I see the rolling stones every year.""
B: ""Man your lucky I am a baby delivery nurse and the pay sucks""
A: ""Maybe you should consider going back to school. I did. I major in economics.""
B: ""I have to walk 3 miles to work to save money everyday what do you do?""
A: ""I mostly eat a fresh and raw diet, so I save on groceries.""
B: ""Your economic skills are amazing""
A: ""Thank you very much! I'm sure you are a great nurse.""
B: ""I'm a ok nurse I have dripped some babies though but I'm getting better""
A: ""I got $50 worth of coupons for fresh fruit and vegetables.""
B: ""That's awesome! How did you manage to score that?""
A: ""I joined a couponing group and won a raffle, it will really help out. How has work been lately?""
B: ""I should do the same! Work is just as bad as ever. I dropped another baby and received a pay penalty because of it. It's going to be a tough month.""
A: ""Oh no! That must be so scary. Can you switch departments?""
B: ""At this point it's not possible without getting an even greater reduction in pay. I'm still toying with the idea of returning to school.""
A: ""That's not a bad idea, maybe go back to school and find your passion. Maybe you could even hit Disney before school started.""
B: ""Haha maybe I should go to school in Orlando. Speaking of school, how is your degree coming along?""
A: ""Good, I was finally able to find a job that valued it. Who knew economics wouldn't be easily employable. What would you go back to school for?""
B: ""Given your experience, possibly economics! Definitely something that doesn't involve hospitals.""
A: ""Haha I can only imagine how bad you need a break from hospitals. If you'd like I can show you how to coupon to help save money when you go back in school""
B: ""I'd really appreciate that! Hopefully I'll qualify for some scholarships, but I'll need to save every dollar I can.""
A: ""What happened at work, were you punished or has it blown over?""
B: ""Yes thankfully its all blown over, wont be doing that again. Hows your job been going?""
A: ""I'm so glad to hear that it all got sorted for you. My job has just been incredible they have welcomed me to their group, feels like I have always worked there. ""
B: ""Thankyou. Oh im so glad to hear that its all going so well for you. You really have worked so hard to get to where you are. I bet your wife and kids are so proud of you!""
A: ""Yes they are just happy that I'm now happy in a job doing what I love to do. I know previously you have said you want to learn how to save using coupons my wife would be more and happy to give you some tips if you like. ""
B: ""Thats so good to hear. Omg that would be so amazing of her to do that for me i will message her in the week to see when she is free, thankyou so much. How are the kids doing?""
A: ""No worries at all she would love to be able to get with someone to do that. And my kids are doing amazing they are adjusting to the new house now and love it. They have made so many new friends and love their new school, so really is the best decision we made to move here. ""
B: ""That is great to hear that they are settling in well. I know some kids have a hard time adjusting but your kids are just amazing. How are you finding the new area you live in?""
A: ""It is honestly beautiful, our new neighbours have been so welcoming and we are actually have a get together this weekend you should come over too if your not busy!""
B: ""That so awesome to hear you all loving your new area you live in. That would be great i will message you later on in the week to see if i am able to make it, thanks. ""
A: ""Your more than welcome. It has been a while since we have seen you and I know the kids will be so happy maybe we will make it a surprise for them if you can come. ""
B: ""Oh yeah that would be good, i sure have missed those kids of yours.  Have you been to any new concerts lately?""
A: ""Have things improved at work?""
B: ""Not really, the job is really demanding and doesn't pay very well.  I would like to go back to school if I could afford it.""
A: ""What would you want to study if you went back to school?""
B: ""I am really interested in business and the economy, so I was thinking economics.  Definitely nothing related to medicine!""
A: ""That is quite a change but if you are not happy doing what you are doing then go for it. I can tell you that doing a job in an area you enjoy is worth the hassle of retraining. ""
B: ""I agree and hope I can follow through.  I was wondering how your move into your new home was going?""
A: ""It went well. I haven't got much inside yet as I don't have much money. However, I have big plans for the future for the space.""
B: ""Sounds great!  Does the  house need a lot of work?""
A: ""No not at all but I want to furnish it properly. It is just empty space at the moment. ""
B: ""Well, hopefully you'll make lots of money at your new job and you'll get all the furniture you want!""
A: ""I'm hoping so. I'll still have no money though as I will be spending it all on the new house!""
B: ""At least those are worthwile expenses.  Your an economist, so I trust you'll figure out the best way to spend your money.""

"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""Hello what are doing today?""
B: ""I am good, I just got off work and tired, I have two jobs.""
A: ""I just got done watching a horror movie""
B: ""I rather read, I've read about 20 books this year.""
A: ""Wow! I do love a good horror movie. Loving this cooler weather""
B: ""But a good movie is always good.""
A: ""Yes! My son is in junior high and I just started letting him watch them too""
B: ""I work in the movies as well.""
A: ""Neat!! I used to work in the human services field""
B: ""Yes it is neat, I stunt double, it is so much fun and hard work.""
A: ""Yes I bet you can get hurt. My wife works and I stay at home""
B: ""Nice, I only have one parent so now I help out my mom.""
A: ""I bet she appreciates that very much.""
B: ""She raised me right, I am just like her.""
A: ""My dad was always busy working at home depot""
B: ""Now that I am older home depot is my toy r us.""
A: ""I've heard they're making a new Stephen King adaptation - I bet I end up going to see it!""
B: ""Yeah, I am trying to get in on that one! I want to be in one of his movies because they are bomb!""
A: ""So cool. Where I live they filmed the Shawshank Redemption.  I know some people who were doubles in it. I love horror but true crime is my favorite thing to read. What kind of books have you read so far this year? Any you recommend? ""
B: ""Oh yeah. I read this one book called The Butterfly Garden by Dot Huchinson. It was very dark and disturbing, but it was true crime/fiction. And it is still haunting me. It is a book in her collectors series. I have not yet been able to get myself to read the others in that series because it hit me pretty hard.""
A: ""Wow. That sounds like something I would really love. I just finished a book myself this morning about a serial killer. Do you read your books through Kindle? Or check them out from the library? ""
B: ""I have kindle unlimited and the libby app, but I believe that particular one was on Kindle Unlimited. It was about teenaged girls being kidnapped and locked in a giant jar and turned into butterflies permanently after the man and his son had their way with them. So I had to lay off her books for a bit. Oh! I also read Billy Straight. that was on libby from my library. It is AMAZING. and it is a true crime story! What was the book you read?""
A: ""I have never heard of the Libby app. I'll have to check that out. I use Kindle because I have Amazon Prime and there are a ton of free books to find that way. The book I read was called Fatal Charm. It was about a husband who murdered two of his wives staging it to look like accidents each time. I hope to find another similar one to read next. What was Billy Straight about?""
B: ""Billy Straight is about a runaway kid that goes to hollywood and pretends to be in school but lives in a park. He witnesses a high profile murder and the cops are searching for him, thinking it was like an old bag lady, but confused as to why the possible witness had a presidents book wrapped in plastic out there. I have Amazon Prime as well. The first book I mentioned may be available on Prime reading. The libby app is an app where you can use your local library card to borrow books virtually and read them on your kindle.""
A: ""Oh ok. I have used other type of apps where it syncs up with the library number to check books out. I really love that option when checking out books now. Makes it so easy and convenient! ""
B: ""Yeah it does! I am so happy to have someone to talk about books with! Not many people that I know appreciate them as much as they should. Plus everyone always wants to know what cool stunts I have been a part of, they forget that my favorite hobby  is reading everything ever written haha. ""
A: ""You never know, with everything you have done in your past, I might read a book about YOU eventually! I can't even imagine what interesting stuff you'd be able to put in a book like that. My life is pretty monotonous so there wouldn't be much to put in a book about me. ""
B: ""I mean, you said you like Stephen King. And Shawshank. I read that book. It was pretty boring. But it was also amazing. You never know what someone else might like to read. Also, doing stunts isn't always fun or exciting. Sometimes it is just falling off a roof and having to lay up for 7 weeks over a broken ankle. Nobody wants to hear about binge reading all of Jeff Wheelers books!""
A: ""What other books have you read in your life that really stand out to you?""
B: ""Dr Seuss' Old Hat New Hat has always resonated with me.  Are you familiar with it? ""
A: ""Haha I think I may have read it years ago as a kid. Remind me what it's about?""
B: ""A character is shopping for hats and trying all types of hats on and none are suitable until he finds his old hat which he had taken off when he entered the hat store.  Not an actual classic, but lots of fun.""
A: ""Well my son is probably too old for it at this point, but I might volunteer to read it for the kids group at the library!""
B: ""I often take it out when I am having a rough day at work...it is mindless fun.  Almost as much as the stunt double work I just did.""
A: ""That sounds like an incredible amount of fun, but anything but mindless! What was your last stunt gig?""
B: ""I stood in for the actor who is playing Rocky Balboa in a remake of the original Rocky movie.  ""
A: ""Wow, I'm super impressed! Tell me, what sorts of stunts do you have to do for this one? My imagination is running wild.""
B: ""Just imagine getting punched over and over again!""
A: ""Oof, talk about working hard for the money! Hopefully you're getting free visits to a massage therapist as part of the package!""
B: ""Only the real stars get that treatment.  The stunt doubles get old coffee and donuts in the trailer.""
A: ""Do you have any new stunt double jobs coming  up?""
B: ""No, I don't have any at this time.""
A: ""You must have a lot of free time to read then.  Are you reading anything good now?""
B: ""I am reading The Butterfly Garden book, and it is good.  How was Fatal Charm?""
A: ""It was very good, I love true crime books!  I'm definitely on the look out for something similar.  I spend a lot of time in the library, so I'll find something.""
B: ""I also love True Crime!  Do you watch movies about True Crime as well?""
A: ""Of course, I'll watch or read anything true crime related.  My kindle is just filled with crime books.  What was your experience with The Butterfly Garden?""
B: ""It was so creepy it still enters my dreams.  I see you like Steven King movies, but what about his books?""
A: ""I love the books more!  I'll never watch a Steven King movie until I've read the book.  I think the IT movies may have ruined clowns for me forever.""
B: ""I did not see IT, but heard it was scary!""
A: ""Shawshank is actually one of my favorite movies and I thought the book was good as well.  I'm surprised you found it boring.""
B: ""I still thought it was amazing, but it wasn't my style of book""

"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""How are you? I'm tired of my parents bothering me, hoping to move out soon.""
B: ""I completely get it. My mom is way too traditional for me!""
A: ""I never drink or use drugs. I am 19 and just want to see my friends.""
B: ""I understand. When do you think you might be able to move?""
A: ""Not sure. I have a part time job at burger king. Do you work?""
B: ""I do. I coach swimming at the pool near my house.""
A: ""Awesome. My parents are just always on me about something. Are you moving soon?""
B: ""I'm still in school. I cannot move until I finish my degree""
A: ""That must be tough. What do you study?""
B: ""I want to be a computer programmer. Are you in school?""
A: ""Yes, I am studying education and working part time.""
B: ""That sounds interesting. Do you like it?""
A: ""Yes, I love it. How are your courses?""
B: ""They are great. I really like the challenge. What do you want to teach?""
A: ""I hope to teach elementary school. How much longer until you graduate?""
B: ""Three more years. I feel like I wil never get out. How about you?""
A: ""Same for me! Looking forward to being done and out of my parents house!""
B: ""Things are so strict. My family is from india, so they just don't get it.""
A: ""Does your college have a dorm? Mine just called, I forgot I was even on the waiting list, and I get to move out! Check into it okay?""
B: ""Oh wow, that sounds great! I'm envious that you're able to move out. I can't move out. My college has a dorm but I'm not able to move out for now. Do you think you'll be able to concentrate on your studies while living in a dorm?""
A: ""I have always loved to study, so that should not be a problem. I don't like to party, I do want to hang out and maybe have a few video game or movie nights""
B: ""Maybe I can come visit you in your dorm room so I feel more like I'm in college and not living with my parents. Do you think you'll try to form a study group?""
A: ""Oh yes. I am all about meeting to study together. I have not had one in a year or two, but we used to do like every week a different person would get their parents to buy lunch or dinner, depending on when the meeting was. Like now, I guess that it would have to be one of us haha. But we would have like pizza and pop or burgers and fries. One girl always brought edible arrangement fruit bouquets and those were amazing! We all loved her day. They came with like caramel and yogurt fruit dip! Would you consider joining a group like that? ""
B: ""Oh yes, that would be great! I'd love to join a group like that. I feel like that would really make me feel like I'm part of a group and not just going to class every day and going back to my parent's hosue. ""
A: ""We can even have slumber parties to watch a movie after if the dorm allows sleeping over. Idk, I have to find out. But like a once a week slumber party with food and a movie would be amazing! And I have access to HBO Max, so we can watch a newly released movie without having to pay for it like once or twice a month!""
B: ""Oh wow!  That's great! That sounds like a ton of fun. Studying turned into fun, who would've thought! I'm sure the dorm room would allow I would think.""
A: ""I hope so! Now I am more excited! We have to decide what subjects we can study together and which ones we will have to like just help out with. Like if you are taking algebra, then I can help, but I am taking a higher math. But if we are both taking BIO, we can study that together!""
B: ""That sounds good, I'm definitely taking BIO right now. It's honestly kind of a waste of time though because it's not my major but pre-requisites suck. I wish they weren't a thing at all. Seems like a waste of money.""
A: ""Yeah. I am working on getting my childhood education degree concentration in my favorite subject, math. But I have to take English and Bio and Art. I won't be teaching any of that so IDK why they are forcing me to take them. But I like to learn so. Oh well I guess.""
B: ""I know, don't you hate that? But like you said, I like to learn too! Just lots of money. ""
A: ""I decided I could probably use some study help with bio after all""
B: ""So will you get a study group started to help with that?""
A: ""Yes I'm taking to a couple of my classmates to see if they can help me set one up. ""
B: ""That sounds like a good idea. I don't like bio much, so I would definitely join a study group to help!""
A: ""Well once I have one together I will let you know so you can join also. How's the rest of your classes going? ""
B: ""That would be great, thanks! The rest of my classes are going well. I still enjoy them, but I don't have much time to socialize.""
A: ""Yes I am in the same situation. Studying is taking up so much of my time but I trying to come out with the perfect Gpa score so that's what it takes. ""
B: ""That is a great goal! My traditional parents would be very happy if I had a perfect GPA as well. I am hoping to get as close as I can. I would love to visit the dorms sometime. ""
A: ""I'm sure you will get it. You are also studying very hard I'm sure you parents are so proud of you. You should defiantly come visit and I will show you around. ""
B: ""Thanks, that's nice of you to say, and it would be great to have someone to show me around! The campus seems so large, I would probably get lost easily. How is your part time job going?""
A: ""Yes it very large but you soon get used to getting around. And it's going well but I wish I had more time in my days to get everything I need done. But I do like having a little break from school work. ""
B: ""Do you enjoy working at Burger King? Does it pay well?""
A: ""I got called in for a shift at work.""
B: ""I hear you, that sounds rough. Hope you had enough rest. Are you going in, or turning down the offer? ""
A: ""I'm going in, I could use the extra hours.""
B: ""Money is a good thing, even if you have to give up time to get it. I've got a bunch of reading to do this week, for school. ""
A: ""Is there any particular study you'll be doing the reading for?""
B: ""I'm studying a computer coding language. Very repetitive. How about your studies? ""
A: ""I'm done with my studies. What made you pic computer coding as a subject of study?""
B: ""Well that was quick, and so much detail there! heheh. Coding is something my mind does very well, and it just makes sense to me, to work through. No studies, and just moved to the dorms. What's that like? ""
A: ""It's good. I've been enjoying my free time now and can partake in more of my hobbies. How long have you been coding for?""
B: ""A few years now, although I guess it takes a few years to good, just like your hobbies. Tell me one specific hobby you have!""
A: ""I've just been binging a lot of hbo lately. Mostly catching up on old tv shows. Do you have hbo max?""
B: ""I'm not sure, would have to check with my parents on that. Lately, haven't been hunting for things to watch. Sounds like you may have a hobby as a movie critic some day. ""

"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""Hi, how are you doing today?""
B: ""Good! You! Celebrating with fellow centenarians""
A: ""Nice. I'm playing some card games with my family.""
B: ""That sounds like fun. I like wine and dancing too!""
A: ""Same. I try to get a small workout in a three mile walk for me is key.""
B: ""Awesome! Walking like that you might live forever like me!!""
A: ""That's true. My favorite way to unwind is reading a book.""
B: ""You sound very like minded, just add some wine""
A: ""Which do you prefer white or red?""
B: ""Fermented. I prefer well aged and fermented. I could bathe in it!""
A: ""Good choice. I always like a nice dry white wine.""
B: ""I think I should go grab a bottle now and get some dancing music on""
A: ""Sounds like a good way to enjoy a sunday afternoon.""
B: ""Yes indeed. Being a centenarian you learn to appreciate these things""
A: ""Since you've reached such an old age, do you have any advice for how to stay healthy and live long?""
B: ""I think it is luck I drink wine. I don't watch what I eat. I just try and enjoy life especially at my age.""
A: ""Haha well they say that wine keeps you young, so maybe there's something to it. Have you tried any great wines lately?""
B: ""I tried a Malbec just yesterday that was wonderful. I drank the whole bottle haha. what about you?""
A: ""I tried a Rhone wine yesterday, and it was fire! I'm amazed you could finish an entire bottle!""
B: ""Oh a bottle isn't that much. Remember I'm 100. I don't work. I have wine with my lunch and if it is a good bottle, that is my beverage for the day.""
A: ""That's a good approach! Sounds like a great way to economize, too!""
B: ""That's right. How  is your family? how many of you are there?""
A: ""There are four of us! I have an older brother and my two parents. Us men like to enjoy a cigar together in the evenings.""
B: ""I have had some cigars I like, but never got into it. Maybe that has helped me live a long time.""
A: ""That's definitely true. Though since you've already made it this long, I doubt smoking a few cigars here and there would hurt!""
B: ""Even if it does, I have lived a good life. I just want to enjoy all the time I have left whether that is a week a year or even another decade.""
A: ""There's a new wine subscription service that let you try different wines on a monthly basis. I am thinking about trying it. How about you?""
B: ""Yes same here. Sometimes even if you pay high price, still the flavor is not that smooth. Don't you agree?""
A: ""I am not sure how much choice you get. Is your service very expensive?""
B: ""Yes a little bit expensive. Can you recommend any new good wine with affordable price as well as quality is nice?""
A: ""I really prefer sangrias, although some find them a bit too sweet. Do you like sweet wines?""
B: ""Yes, but not that much sweet. I will try your wine label next time. I hope it will taste nice.""
A: ""it is. Do you then prefer dry wines? red or white?""
B: ""I absolutely love red wine. I think you like the white one?""
A: ""whites I love, like a good schwartzkatz...german wines You more french or german?""
B: ""I heard a lot of good things about German wines. I always prefer French wine though.""
A: ""what is your favorite french wine?""
B: ""Bordeaux red is my favorite one. Have you tried it?""
A: ""What do you attribute your longevity to?""
B: ""Well, I think it has to do in part with not smoking. Also, I think the red wine has provided me with lasting health benefits.""
A: ""Doctors do say that red wine is great for health. Wish I could get into red wine more, I do prefer the white. Had a great gewurztraminer this month. ""
B: ""What in tarnation is a gewurztraminer? I've never heard of that wine.""
A: ""It's a German white wine, you say you prefer French reds. Wonder if you'll ever get curious and try more German white wines! ""
B: ""Hey, if it's got booze in it, I'm willing to give it a whirl! Can I buy gewurztraminer wine anywhere?""
A: ""I've seen it in a handful of stores, and I'm not in the largest city, so yes. It's usually on the menu at my favorite high end restaurant in town. It's not the most expensive, but has a nice bright sweetness. What's the last red wine you've had?  ""
B: ""I'll look for it the next time I visit my favorite wine shops. You might laugh, but the last wine I had was Yago! Sangria. I was at a friend's house and that's all they had. It's not quite up to my snobbish, elitist standards, to say the least.""
A: ""Ah, variety is the spice of life, they say. Sangria can pack a bit to it sometimes.  I hope it was a good one. The last red I really enjoyed, was a tawny port wine. ""
B: ""Port is nice, too. It's quite heady and strong. So, what else have you been up to besides guzzling vino and smoking stogies? Ha!""
A: ""Oh, been chatting with a few friends with wild senses of humor. That may be you, hehe. Lining up my week, considering when exercise will happen. You? ""

B: ""Oh wow, I can imagine it was a very hard time""
A: ""It was, but it made us strong.""
B: ""Yes it really did, that's why I enjoy y volunteer work""
A: ""You have inspired me I signed up with a local soup kitchen to help during the holidays, maybe it will help with my seasonal depression.""
B: ""I think that this will actually be great for you! How do you feel now?""
A: ""I am feeling hopeful. Since I grew up poor, I know how it feels to be helped when you need it and I'm happy to do that for someone else.""
B: ""Yes, that is why the soup kitchen idea is such a joy!""
A: ""What inspired you to dye your hair purple?""
B: ""I just wanted something different at the moment! Would you ever consider dying your hair?""
A: ""I don't think so, I'm way too old for that. I don't have much hair anymore!""
B: ""Well, I think you could still do something cool perhaps! Any ideas?""
A: ""I would like to change my wardrobe. I haven't bought new clothes in about 15 years. ""
B: ""Wow, that would be so fun! Maybe you could try a store like Macy's!""
A: ""I like Macy's. I used to shop there. Shopping is very hard for someone my age, though.""
B: ""Right, I could just imagine. Perhaps hiring a shopper would be better then?""
A: ""I've been thinking about the soup kitchen and might want to invite you at the same time you are.""
B: ""Oh yes that would be great. I normally go down on friday's and sunday's if any of those days work for you?""
A: ""Those days do indeed work for me. How long are the shifts, and what time of day do they take place?""
B: ""Ok perfect sound like a plan then. The shifts are usually about 4 hours and they start at around 10am. Would you like to check out Macy's once we are done?""
A: ""We could certainly do that if the store isn't too far from the soup kitchen. I'd appreciate your input regarding fashion.""
B: ""Yes its not to far and i will drive us and take you home after. Yes i can defiantly help, i love to shop for new clothes so will probably get my some new stuff too. ""
A: ""That's very kind of you. What sort of budget do you suggest I have for this shopping trip?""
B: ""Your welcome. I would say around $50 you could probably get atleast two whole new outfits with that. Macy's usually have some amazing deals. ""
A: ""That's not bad! I was expecting much worse, but with my memory being so bad, I can't even remember what I spent last time I shopped for clothes!""
B: ""Yeah Macy's sure is the place to shop. I know you said you dont like the holidays but if you like you can spend Thanksgiving with my family this year if you like? ""
A: ""That's very sweet of you to offer. I think I'll be free then. Will your family be coming into town, or would I need to plan to travel?""
B: ""Your welcome. And my family is coming to my house this year so you don't have to travel too far. ""
A: ""I love my new outfits will you help me shop again?""
B: ""Absolutely! I'm itching to go shopping, especially with summer coming up. We can hit Macy's, Lord & Taylor, and Nordstrom Rack.""
A: ""Ooh, those sound like a good idea. Might also hit up Dillards and J.C. Penny. Actually, are those still around? I thought J.C. Penny went bankrupt a while back.""
B: ""We can hit those stores, too. I'd like to go to Hot Topic, also, as they have cool garb that would go well with my purple hair. J.C. Penney did file bankruptcy in 2020, and they closed many stores, but they are still operating.""
A: ""Oh, it's good to know they're still around. They've always got a bunch of good clearance deals. Hot Topic sounds like a must-visit as well. I've never shopped there before. What sets it apart?""
B: ""I'm all about the clearance deals! I think I've got a keen eye for bargains because my family didn't have much money while I was growing up. Hot Topic has a lot of rock band merchandise, gothic wear, punk rock wear, music, accessories, and more.""
A: ""I grew up poor as well. Well, actually, basically everyone was poor during the depression. Ooh, Hot Topic sounds great, especially for younger folks. I'm not sure it'd fit my old geezer style, though. I'd be happy to check it out, however.""
B: ""I can't imagine how tough it was to go through the Great Depression. I'm glad you decided to volunteer for the soup kitchen, though. You're going to feel so good about yourself helping needy folks during the holidays.""
A: ""Yeah, it helps keep my spirits up. The holidays are cold, plus everyone I love is dead and I'm without anyone to celebrate with, so I'm pretty miserable during the holidays. Volunteering keeps me occupied.""
B: ""I'm sorry to hear you have a rough time during the holidays. Have you ever done any volunteer work before?""
A: ""I have. I used to volunteer at an animal shelter, but that requires me to chase animals around, and I'm too old for that kind of stuff now. Ladling soup and greeting people sounds like a more doable task for me. ""
B: ""I've never volunteered at an animal shelter, before, but it's something to consider. I'm an animal lover, as well.""

A: ""Hello, how are you doing?""
B: ""Hello. Pretty good, thanks. And yourself?""
A: ""Awesome, I just got back from a bike ride.""
B: ""Cool! Do you spend a lot of time biking?""
A: ""Yup. Its my favorite thing to do. Do you?""
B: ""I love playing folk music. I actually hope to be a professional musician someday""
A: ""That's interesting. What instruments do you play?""
B: ""I can play the guitar and the piano and I also like to sing.""
A: ""I can only sing when I drink, but I don't like to do that anymore.""
B: ""I m not a big drinker either. Do you have a job?""
A: ""Construction, like my dad. What do you do when you aren't being a rock star""
B: ""Nice! I work as a custodian. Not too glamorous but it pays the bills haha""
A: ""I feel ya. You gotta do what you gotta do.""
B: ""Exactly. Do you have other hobbies besides biking?""
A: ""Today's weather was beautiful for biking.  It was the first thing I did after my long day working my construction job.  Did you get to play any guitar or piano today?  Or perhaps a drink at a local bar?""
B: ""I did fiddle around with my guitar a little.  I played some Bob Dylan after I ate.""
A: ""Nice. Is Dylan a favorite of yours? I haven't been much into music in a long time but sometimes I wish I listened to more.""
B: ""Yes, I've always loved Dylan.  I think he's such a musical genius. He's not the only reason I want to get into music, but he's one of them.""
A: ""Since you're so interested in music, do you ever get out to see local bands? I used to go to concerts every few months when I was younger.""
B: ""Yes, I try to stay connected to the local music scene, and also try to see bigger acts when they come to town, although money and time are always consideration too.  What was the last concert you went to?""
A: ""Yeah, it's definitely hard to find time nowadays. I think the last concert I went to see might have been a pair of cellists with some friends. I think they were called 2Cellos but I could be mistaken.""
B: ""Oh, nice.  Have you heard of Mark O'Connor?  I once saw him in concert with Yo-Yo Ma.  That was amazing.""
A: ""Yeah, I think I ran across some of his performances on YouTube at some point. I could listen to violin and cello music all the time if I had the opportunity. I like to put on videos in the background to provide some background noise. And an occasional distraction.""
B: ""Yes, I love listening to classic or baroque if I'm doing something that needs concentration.  Do you listen to music when you ride your bike?""
A: ""I should. Usually I'm listening to podcasts when I'm riding my bike. Since I don't have much time I try to keep abreast of current events that way.""
B: ""Yes, that's a good time to kill two birds with one stone.  I've never really gotten into podcasts.  What type of podcast topics do you listen to?""
A: ""I watched a really cool Youtube video about how Cellos are made. ""
B: ""Cool any process of making an instrument is beautiful to me. Did you search it up or was it a recommend youtube video?""
A: ""It was recommended to me.  You know how those algorithms sometimes seem to read your mind.  But I saw the thumbnail and started watching and got hooked.""
B: ""Those thumbnails really get you to watch just about anything. Whats your favorite podcast to listen to?""
A: ""I tend to bounce around.  I think I get hooked by the personalities and then sort of get tired of them.  But right now I'm listening to one that talks about unsolved crimes.""
B: ""Very cool, my dad listened to a podcast about the zodiac killer a while back, its an interesting story. Where do you usually ride your bike?""
A: ""I mostly ride on streets, albeit pretty quiet streets.  But sometimes I'll take my bike and go on trails or off road.  It take a little longer to do those types of rides, though, so I do them less frequently.""
B: ""A nice bike ride feels great especially in perfect climate. Whats your favorite drink?""
A: ""Well, I used to like a nice rum and Coke back when I was drinking more.  But now I love a lemonade as a treat on a hot summer day, and coconut water most other days.  How about you?""
B: ""I don't tend to drink that much but when i do i like to sip on some Kentucky Bourbon. Blanton is my favorite. Do you have your own construction company or do you work for somebody? ""
A: ""I work for someone.  I got the job through my dad.  They company and owner have been good to my family so I'm happy to work for him.""
B: ""Thats great to hear, connections go a long way.""
A: ""I've just watched another really interesting video about how guitars are made.""
B: ""That sounds so cool! What is the most interesting fact that you learned?""
A: ""I didn't know guitar strings were mostly made of steel and nickel.  ""
B: ""That is really interesting, are violin and cello strings also made of steel and nickel, I wonder?""
A: ""Good question, not sure of cello, but violin strings are made of different material depending on the chord.  Could be nylon, steel or even sheep intestine!""
B: ""Sheep intestine! I have never heard of that. Has it inspired you to listen to more music?""
A: ""No, actually, it has inspired me to drink more Bourbon and to find out how it's made!""
B: ""That is a great idea! I sure do love my bourbon, but I have no idea how it is made. You have a curious mind! What is your favorite subject to read or study up on ?""
A: ""I am fascinated by forensics related to unsolved crimes.  ""
B: ""That sounds extremely fascinating. Have you ever watched the series ""Mindhunter""? Not unsolved crimes, but getting into the minds of serial killers. Pretty cool.""
A: ""No, never saw it, but I will look into it...is it available on Netflix?  ""
B: ""Yes, it is on Netflix! It is based on the true story of when the FBI first started ""profiling"" serial killers. It is what the show Criminal Minds is based on, if you have ever watched that.""

A: ""Have you taken your mum for a Mexican meal yet? Was my arroz con pollos a hit?""

A: ""I haven't really decided yet. Maybe I'll just backpack across the US. I haven't been to the west coast much, and the pacific northwest looks very peaceful and scenic. Maybe I can check that area of the country out.""

B: ""Yes, I do find that things seem to break more readily nowadays.  It's a disposable world.  What do you do most in your new couch?  Watch TV, read, take a nap?""
A: ""To be honest, My kids use it more than I do. But, when I do find time to relax, I like to read. The TV is usually occupied by my 9 year old.""
B: ""Yes, young ones do usually monopolize the screens.  What does your nine-year-old like to watch, not that I'd know any of the shows these days.""
A: ""Since my family has had some time to enjoy the new couch, would you be interested in coming over to try it out?""
B: ""I would love to come try it out and see what the big deal about deep seat couches is all about!""
A: ""You're welcome to come by anytime, but be warned that you'll have to compete for couch space with my two kids, especially my little girl, who is perpetually glued to the boob tube.""
B: ""I'm sure they will let an old lady like me have a seat at the new couch!""
A: ""I'll tell them to play nicely with you. How did your new couch come out when you had it upholstered?""
B: ""Oh you know me! I can't tell the difference and a couch is a couch! Maybe trying out your couch will enlighten me to the world of couches!""
A: ""Ha! How's your job at the library going? Anything fun, exciting, or noteworthy?""
B: ""Working at the library is always a good time for me - familiar, friendly faces and a ton of knowledge for everyone! You should come visit at the library with your kids more.""
A: ""We will! My high-school aged kid has an English term paper due in a few weeks, so I'll have him drive over there to do some research. ""
B: ""I look forward to seeing him. I'll do my best with helping him on his paper! Helping students is one of my favorites as a librarian. ""
A: ""I appreciate that. Maybe you could ask him to help you learn to use Facebook. I bet your kids would get a kick out of their old mother messaging them on Facebook!""

B: ""No, not at all. I thought you were in the Army?""
A: ""Yes I am, I am still a part of the Canadian Army. My contract lasts for about two years from now. I dropped out of college for it, but I might be interested in going back after my contract expires. Are you planning on continuing your education after college?""
B: ""No, I am done with school. I plan on starting a small business. Have you ever owned a business?""
A: ""No I have not, seems like a challenge to me. What kind of business are you interested in starting?""
B: ""I want to own my own bookstore.""
A: ""That sounds cool, I'm sure it will work out well for you given your experience in working in a bookstore. Are you considering in specializing in a specific genre to sell?""
B: ""No, not really. I intend to have a vast sellection. What do you do for fun?""
A: ""I just saw a chemistry book in a bookstore window!""
B: ""I am not a big book fan -- I like audio books instead! do you enjoy using your chemistry lab?""
A: ""Yes, I love to do little experiments with it!  I don't really enjoy reading either, but I was kind of intrigued by the chemistry book haha!""
B: ""totally! it's helpful to have a guide for that kind of hobby.  wish I had the space for it! do you have to live on base for the army?""
A: ""No, I'm in an apartment just off the base, so I had a bit of space for my hobbies.  Do you have a plan to get to your goal of owning a bookstore?  I imagine it's a complicated process to own your own business!""
B: ""that's my hope -- trying to find space to rent is so hard though! I can't decide on what a good location is. think I should aim for a downtown area or a suburb?""
A: ""There are certainly benefits with either choice of location.  Is the bookstore you currently work in located right in the city?  I bet that's a very expensive location.""
B: ""yes it is. the foot traffic is good for business though. I worry if I move away from here I won't have that. do you know what you'd wanna major in if you went back to school?""
A: ""I'm not 100% sure yet but I'm thinking that I'll go into something related to chemistry since I have an interest in that.  Maybe forensic science!""
B: ""that would be really cool. with your military experience that would set you up for many good law enforcement type jobs""
A: ""Exactly!  But first I have to finish my commitment to the Army.  Did you ever consider a military career?""
B: ""I did, but I ended up wanting to go to school or do other things -- it seemed like such a big commitment""
A: ""Hey I know some people and I may know a good affordable place you could rent for your business.""
B: ""Really? That would be fantastic! I would love to get in contact with them. Do you know what area it is in?""
A: ""It is is in Brooklyn and I am sure it would be perfect for your bookstore. ""
B: ""That's great to hear! If this works out, you'll have to come visit when you are out of the Army, even if you don't like books much. Have you considered any school programs for when you are done?""
A: ""Thanks, yes I will. I have been considering forensic science but not sure what the job market is like in that area.""
B: ""That makes sense. Hopefully you can find someone in the industry that might have some insight. Do you think you would stay around Vancouver, either for school or after?""
A: ""I think I might travel somewhere else to look for work. I am used to constantly travelling being in the army so tat does not bother me. I suppose crime will always happen so there is demand for the work. ""
B: ""That's a good point! It seems like it could be a good mix of mystery and hard science if you choose to pursue it. I know reading isn't your favorite, but maybe finding a good Sherlock Holmes or other crime-solving novel could spark your interest!""
A: ""Maybe I could come by your bookstore and pick up a few crime book to get me started. Never enjoy reading but that might be because I haven't found the right ones.""
B: ""I would love to help you find some great books to get you started. If you're like me, you might prefer audio books that you can listen to while you travel.""
A: ""That's a good idea. I think some of the reason I do not like reading is the actual reading. Listening to some audio books could make it more enjoyable for me, thanks for the suggestion!""

B: ""No, but I've heard about it. It's those little things that look almost like a snail shell, right? And it's like potato, but... not? Lol.""
A: ""Exactly, the sauce I put on those things is just amazing. I will also have to make you my wagon wheel pasta but, it is extremely time consuming to make so, I will need advance notice before you come over and eat those.""

A: ""An early harvest then, although new sprouts will grow to replace. That's pretty exciting. I have to pace the job search thing, can get burnt out on it sometimes. A little gardening and fresh air, might do me good. I like that you're feeding yourself, with your own grown food!""
B: ""I love being able to just go out and pick my own food - it makes me feel really at one with nature. I would really recommend getting outside and growing something - especially when you spend so much time behind a computer screen. It's good for your mental health ""
A: ""Agreed. It's also something to be mindful of, you have to nurture and maintain it. I try to be careful about what responsibilities I take on... can barely keep my house plants green! Still want to though. ""
B: ""Hey it's the effort that counts - I killed a lot of veggies before I got the hang of gardening!""
A: ""I hear you, yes, it's a process definitely. Two steps forward, one step back. I've been thinking about Romaine lettuce, love that in salads. You have fave plants in the garden?""
B: ""Oh I love Romaine too! I think my favourite veg to grow are tomatoes though, you get to pick them when they get to your colour preference - green or red!""
A: ""Tomatoes too, they are so productive a plant. Cherry tomatoes are a fave, I like how they can have a smokey flavor sometimes. Green tomatoes, haven't eaten many. You fry them?""
B: ""Oh yeah they need to be fried to really enjoy them - I quite like growing chillis too! I love spicy food.""

A: ""That's a good one too. Been a while since I played though. Should I take it back up?""

A: ""I currently have a Dodge Ram 1500 but am thinking of getting a Ford F150. Do you have any info on trucks that you could help me with?""
B: ""Of course, I drive a Ford F150 myself and I would highly recommend it. It has good hauling power and a very powerful engine. In any case, try getting a truck with 4WD if you can.""
A: ""That's what I have now and I tow a little bit so it would be helpful to continue that. Do you use your truck on the farm a lot?""
B: ""Definitely, it is a must have if you work on the farm. I use it to transport farming material, sometimes even livestock if other transport vehicles are occupied.""
A: ""Wow, Ford's must be one tough truck! I am not positive I would transport livestock in my Dodge...""
B: ""I'm sure you could, however I always recommend using a more specialized vehicle if you can. Are you particularly interested in having a truck with more bed space or a bigger cabin?""
A: ""A bigger cabin, I think... What would you recommend? I don't do a ton of transport so I think the cab would be more beneficial.""
B: ""If you don't transport often, a bigger bed isn't really necessary. Its usually better to have a bigger cabin, so more people can be in the car. I know it would be great if more people could carpool with me as I drive my truck.""
A: ""That would be nice. My gas mileage isn't great. I wish I could carpool so it wasn't so wasteful.""
B: ""MPG is another thing to consider for trucks as well, although more modern trucks are much more efficient than older models. Still, they end up being more fuel inefficient than say a sedan or even a coupe.""
A: ""I was looking at trucks and it made me wonder how reliable has your F150 been?""
B: ""It's been good to me. I know some people don't like em, but I've always been a Ford fan.""
A: ""How much will it pull? I'm thinking about getting a couple of horses and I know horse trailers are pretty heavy to tow.""
B: ""Oh I'm not sure about that, I don't pull things too often. But it's never gotten stuck in the mud at my parents farm! Do you have horses?""
A: ""Not yet! I'd love to get some but I'm not sure how much it will cost in total, you know? Gotta think about all the little things not just feed and boarding. I may just wind up getting big dogs instead.""
B: ""I've been around a bunch with my parents farm connections, but I don't know a ton about them. They definitely look like a big commitment, though.""
A: ""Your parents have a dairy farm, right? How's that work going?""
B: ""Pretty good. It's kind of the only work I've ever known, will probably take over some day. I love taking care of the cows.""
A: ""Cows seem so sweet. That's good, I suppose, because they're SO huge! Do they ever frighten you?""
B: ""They can get a little rowdy at times, but not too frightening. I'm used to it. It's like having big dogs, when you see them come up from calves they're not as scary.""
A: ""Yeah, I suppose that's true! They're beautiful animals. Are they friendly, like do they come up for pets and scratches, or are they more like...meh?""
B: ""Depends on the cow. The one that I raised like a pet loves scratches and playing. Others just kinda want to do their own thing.""
A: ""I did it, I bought a new truck!""
B: ""Nice, what did you end up getting?""
A: ""I ended up buying a Ford F-150""
B: ""Welp, I can't argue with that choice. My F150 has been going strong for years. Are you going to pull horse trailers with it?""
A: ""Yes I am going to pull horse trailers with it.""
B: ""It should do a good job with that. Of course, you will lose gas mileage when pulling but that is normal. Did you ever get any big dogs?""
A: ""Yes I do have big dogs""
B: ""What? You went ahead and got some? I remember you saying you wanted to but didn't know you already did. What did you end up getting?""
A: ""I ended up getting them because I liked them""

B: ""That is insane! Must be pretty awesome to see in person. MotoGP bikes are around 200mph too, but I've never seen that in person. ""
A: ""Yeah with how fast they go, they need so much protective equipment too!  I know that NASCAR drivers are primarily wearing fire prevention suits.  I think they wear way more protective gear in motor bikes!  Can never have too much protection when you could easily fall onto the road! Haha do you have a lot of your own equipment then?""
A: ""The latest MotoGP event will be on TV in 7 hours, are you going to watch?""
B: ""Oh 100% I'm excited to see some racing! Are you looking forward to it?""
A: ""Definitely. Wonder what new cars will be up. Love being there in person though. Been getting beer and snacks lined up for the show! ""

A: ""You feel like you are part of something, even if you can't be there just now. We'll have to catch up after the show, who won, all that. Been thinking about your garden, how's that going?""
B: ""Yeah we need to! It's going good - a lot of my tulips are starting to show now and it's really making me smile. I'm just waiting to see what other flowers start to show themselves. Do you do any gardening?""
A: ""Mom used to have a flower garden, but I'm not much of a gardener so far. Thinking about it maybe. Tulips, I've seen some tulip fields that look like magic. Bet you have a few fave tulip colors?""
B: ""Oh I love all colours of Tulips - I've been to Holland before and those guys love Tulips even more than me. I've started to try and grow my own veg recently but that's been a lot of trial and error""
A: ""You definitely have a point. I may consider gardening, you are inspiring!""
B: ""I just love being outside and spending time in nature and not stuck inside all the time!""
A: ""Holland, as you mentioned, yes I've thought about those wooden shoes they are always on about. Wonder if they're comfortable? hehe. Trial and error, got that with gardening. I've  killed a few. We'll have to learn more!""

B: ""I have not had a chance yet.  I'm still trying to figure out who has the best deals for prices.  I can't believe how expensive it is to fix one!  It's so hard to spare the money when you have so many other expenses, ya know?""
A: ""That's frustrating. They make them so hard to fix without taking it right to the original company who basically will charge you the price of a new phone. What broke about it again?""
B: ""The screen.  One of my grandkids was watching youtube videos and dropped it and the screen just shattered.  I bet you're smart enough to not let your kids use your phone!  ha!""
A: ""Hey, it happens. Lets just say they don't use it now, but I've had something pretty similar happen haha. I buy really cheap phones, and then I keep my last one around as backup incase I break one and need a quick replacement. I could send you my old one if you need something for a bit. ""
B: ""That would be great!  I've learned my lesson!  Never again!  The grand kids can use their own devices that their parents buy them if they want to watch YouTube!  Although I think YouTube is terrible anyways!   When is your next Rolling Stones concert happening?""
A: ""I know, there's so much crazy stuff out there. They don't have any shows around here until this winter. I'm looking at two events, either in October or December. ""
B: ""Will it at least be indoors or is it still warm outdoors in the winter there?""
A: ""Yeah thankfully. There is a big stadium they can close the roof on. Nice to be able to sit down for it unlike some shows where you're just standing around a field. ""
B: ""I've seen those stadiums!  They're pretty cool!  Much nicer than the shows in the fields!  How's your step mom doing?""
A: ""Ups and downs. She is pretty tired some days. She has a great spirit about it though, so that's pretty admirable ""
B: ""That's great that she's staying positive.  That mindset always helped me get through the hard times!  Sometimes positive thinking helps more than you'd think!""

A: ""I used to make large batches of banana bread.  It was something that was a bit nutritious and could be packed up well for travel.  I'm not a fa n of McDonalds.  Home food is better""
B: ""Yeah, I totally agree. Home food it way better. You also have that sense of pride. Do you think if you have cooked it yourself, it seems to taste better? I definitely do!""
A: ""For sure, plus I like knowing whats in my food""
B: ""That is one of the main issues when eating out. Although they are somewhat transparent, it is a bit of a pain trying to access the ingredients list. Have you ever asked what's in things when you eat at a restaurant?""
A: ""I don't eat out very often.  When I do I try not to think about whats in the food, knowing will make me feel bad about eating it.""
B: ""I guess that is probably wise. So, do you take care of your body in other ways then? Running, going to the gym etc?""
A: ""i jog around the neighborhood to stay in shape  about 2 miles a day""
B: ""Is it very picturesque there? My surroundings are pretty standard and boring. I would love to hike down some beautiful routes""

B: ""Wow, he sounds like he'd be the perfect sidekick!  What type of dog was he?""
A: ""He was a yellow lab. He was very friendly and loved people. What type of super powers do you think your friends have?""
B: ""We all have different powers that help us work together.  One can go invisible and another stretches and another can move really fast.  Today we foiled a plot to poison the food in the orphanage.""
A: ""I'm glad you were able to stop the bad guys. Have you had any luck finding a dog as a sidekick? You would have loved my lab.""

B: ""Only two of them were acquired at the same time. They are brother and sister and I got them both from a breeder. The others are all rescues. I find it enjoyable to know that I helped out a helpless animal. In fact, I'm always open to rescuing more so I could imagine having up to nine or ten cats.""

B: ""That's a good idea! Maybe I'll start with acoustic to see if I enjoy that, then invest in electric if I ever get decent at it. How long have you been playing?""

B: ""Hello. I'm leigh. I'm at a park I've never been to.""
A: ""Cool. What park? I won homecoming queen and went to the park that night""
B: ""Not sure. I was just exploring the city and found it. How old are you?""

A: ""I'm in band at school. I make straight as! What instruments do you play?""
B: ""I play trombone, alto sax, baritone, and trumpet. You?""
A: ""I play the sax. Do you run? My goal is to run a k!""
B: ""I don't run. I'm constantly moving at the shelter I work at though.""
A: ""You should try to run! Its fun! Moving is good too!""
B: ""No! I'll start violin as a new hobby, like my father.""
A: ""I did play the violin last year in band. I didn't like it""
B: ""It isn't for everyone. My dad made his living. I will try.""
A: ""Did you go to homecoming when you were in school? I had a blast at mine""
B: ""I did not go. Who did you go with?""
A: ""What is it like working at a shelter?""
B: ""Sometimes hard, the stories you hear are pretty sad. But it's always uplifting. Everyone is always pretty thankful for the help. ""
A: ""That's good, yeah I imagine some of the things you would hear are upsetting. It's very good that you help people. How did you get into that line of work?""
B: ""I just started volunteering one day in highschool to get some hours for graduation. I didn't expect to do it long but I felt so needed there and the work seemed so important to me. ""

B: ""Wow, that's more than I've ever run. I just can't push myself like that. ""
A: ""I didn't think I would like running but I actually do. Have you found any new parts of the city?""

A: ""it's good you're willing to explore new things! the hard thing with running is it makes you hungry but you can't always eat when hungry or you'll eat back more than you burn so it is a delicate balance. but I love to have a cheat day once a week to eat whatever treats my heart dsires!""
B: ""How often do you get a cheat day?""
A: ""usually onc e a week, sometimes twice if i've worked out a lot. I usually track my calories but on cheat days I don't, and let myself have whatever I want for the most part""

B: ""How was it? The weather has been terrible recently, did you manage to find a window in which it didn't rain?""
A: ""it's was great! I didn't really feel like it since the weather been crazy but after i finish i felt relaxed again. Yeah i looked at the weather and seen that i had a good hour before it would start again. Do you think you would try running one day?.""
B: ""I have tried running before but only in short bursts. My knees have been giving me a lot of trouble lately. I have booked a doctor's appointment so hopefully a fix can be identified""
A: ""oh okay, hopefully you can find some relief and fix the problem. I love running but when my knee start hurting i give myself a break. That's way i think walking would be good for you because it would help with your knee and is a good workout. how long has your knee been giving you trouble?""

B: ""Three!  Katie, Sally and Ken, they keep me company when my Mom is at work. She works late at night and brings home bags of dollar bills!""

B: ""Yes Milely!  She listens to me tell stories about stuff when I'm waiting for Mom to come home.  With Miley, I'm never alone!""
A: ""In the alleys, are there any foodstuffs that you're likely to pick up? Leftovers?""
B: ""Stores just throw out perfectly good stuff all the time!  We save money so Mom can buy her ""Stuff"" and then we go home and she sleeps all day until it gets dark again.""
A: ""Ah, that makes sense. Sounds pretty tough. Actually reminds me of when I was growing up in Somalia. I'd have killed for some fast food back then.""
B: ""Somalia?  Was there shooting every night like it is here?""
A: ""My favorite subject was dance. I did very well, so well, in fact, that I just received word that I got the job I wanted as a dance coach at a high school!""
B: ""Omg that is great, I would love to be a dancer when I am older. ""
A: ""If you work hard, you could totally do it! It's best to start young!""
B: ""My mom cannot afford to put me in classes. We can barley afford food. ""
A: ""Maybe she could be your teacher? Since your mom is a dancer, you have a unique advantage!""
B: ""She does not do the style of dance I would like to do. I want to be a ballerina. What style of dance do you do?""
A: ""I do ballet! A friend of mine owns a studio where they offer some scholarships. Your mom should look for something like that in your area!""

B: ""Thank you so much, you just made me so happy. I cannot wait to tell my mom. ""
A: ""I've just contacted my friend who owns the dance studio.  She said there'd be no problem for your mum to speak to her.""
B: ""Oh, okay. That's cool! Do you also take ballet classes at your friends studio?""
A: ""I do work out there yes, and dance at the studio. I keep thinking about being paid to teach, although right now, I help others, I dance too. Do you like to dance?""
B: ""I don't mind dancing, but I prefer coloring. I have a doll named Katie that is a ballet dancer though and my mom is a pole dancer!""
A: ""Yes, yes she is. It is cool that you enjoy your dolls, and have one that dances ballet. Bet your mom likes that too. How's your turtle? ""
B: ""Miley is good. She told me an exciting bedtime story the other night about a magical place in the middle of the Earth. Have you ever considered getting a turtle?""
A: ""I like seeing turtles, and hearing about them. Taking care of them, with my busy schedule, might be hard. I really love hearing about Miley. That turtle sounds like great company!""
B: ""Yeah, Miley is a dream. She helps me feel safe in this rough neighborhood and keeps me company since I'm alone a lot.""
A: ""I like knowing you have company when you're in such a situation. I send good thoughts and prayers to you and Miley. Any other dolls that you want to introduce me to? ""
B: ""Yeah, it's nice to talk to someone who grew up in a similar situation. You give me hope for the future. I don't have any new dolls at the moment, but I'm hoping for a new one soon. Maybe my next doll will be a dance coach, like you.""
A: ""That would be great! Your ballet dancer doll and the dance coach can play together, like we play here, when we text. You're creative! ""
B: ""Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking about! If only I could find a coloring coach, then Miley and I would both have coach friends.""

B: ""We have a pretty decent sized yard, and a nice dog park in our neighborhood. But, if I do need a walker, I know who to call!""
A: ""Haha, good to know! There is a lot more competition now, loads of people have started up dog walking business' near me. ""
B: ""I imagine it's an easy business to start, but hard to keep with it. How long have you been doing it?""

A: ""It should be fine. It is pretty flexible and most people understand. What about your work?""
B: ""I guess it could be a nice break from studying sometimes too, getting outside and walking around. It's been fine. Work is work, ups and downs. I can't complain though. Pays the bills. ""
A: ""I have to know! Did you get a dog last weekend?""

A: ""I find rivers, but we could find a local lake or something to practice on. If we bring a friend they could sit with the dogs. Does your lab swim at all?""
B: ""Nice, I bet rivers are a bit more complicated and dangerous? My husband would definitely come with us, so he could mind the dogs :) He does swim, but I'm not sure he enjoys it that much .. He always looks really flustered when he comes out .. a bit like me! ""
A: ""It's not too dangerous depending on where you go. This sounds like a nice day though. I'll pick up some food and we can have lunch or something. I can bring some balls and the dogs can chase them around. ""

A: ""I am excited, it's been a long time in the works. I think I will. I'm staying in town, so I think it will be a nice way to take a break from studying. ""
B: ""Yeah sounds like a plan, you need something else to take your mind off the everyday grind! So how many dogs do you tend to walk at a time? I can't imagine walking more than one - he's an absolute nutter even when he's on a lead! ""

A: ""As I always say, if you've got it, flaunt it! Try wearing clothes that accentuate that unique feature! I could use some help with hanging heavy objects like chandeliers and such. Your powers would be very helpful. ""
B: ""Yes, they really could be of use! I don't mind helping you lifting heavy objects so that we can redecorate your house! I appreciate your suggestion on my appearance. Maybe we could set a date and time to get together and tackle both issues at once?""
A: ""I think that's a good plan! What does your schedule tend to be like?""
B: ""I am pretty open to be honest. What sort of heavy objects would we be working with though? I may need to plan and prepare before we get together.""
A: ""I have a few chandeliers, and there are some heavy urns and sculptures that I need to move out of my garage.""
B: ""Okay, that doesn't sound too daunting. I am thinking maybe early next week we could probably get everything in order, if your schedule will allow? Are you going to be referencing a theme or anything for your new house decorations? ""
A: ""That would work perfectly! I'm going for a classical theme. Lots of marble and plaster and such. I think you'll like it!""
B: ""That does sound lovely! I think maybe we can take inspiration from your home decorating to my appearance possibly? ""
A: ""Are you still going to the doctor often for follow up appointments?""
B: ""Yeah, I have to.  Fortunately my telekinetic powers keep things from bumping into my heart. but i still like the doctor to check things out.""
A: ""I think it is best to have a doctor check everything out. You never know if need any extra help. What led to you needing a new brain?""
B: ""The old one wasn't working quite right.  I couldn't make anything move with it.""
A: ""Was it always broken like that, or did it suddenly stop working?""
B: ""Well, it never could do that, really, that's just a perk with the new brain.  The real problem was that my telepathy started working backwards and everyone could read MY thoughts!""
A: ""Wow that could be a problem. I am not sure I would people to read my mind! Has your new brain changed the way you decorate?""
B: ""Yes, that's why I'm not so busy. I just tell the paintbrush to go to work on it's own, while I try to read the minds of people on TV.""
A: ""That must make it so much easier than having to do the painting. Although I enjoy the feeling of a brush in my hand.""
B: ""See? I knew you were going to say that!  ""
A: ""Do you know I am thinking about at the moment? I will try to hide it from you.""
B: ""You are thinking that your new chandeliers might fall on your head.  Don't worry, I'll use my powers to keep them in place for you!""

A: ""Hello. How are you today?""
B: ""Good today. Just cooking some mexican food. I cooking but am not very good.""
A: ""Oh I like mexican food, but my favorite food are cheeseburgers""
B: ""I inherited some money and bought a yacht to travel, I try different foods traveling""
A: ""I help out at a soup kitchen since I grew up poor.""
B: ""Cheeseburgers are great, I try all kinds of foods everywhere I go, gotta love food.""
A: ""Yes, do you like war documentaries? I do""
B: ""I like travel logs and have been all over the world for years since high school""
A: ""Sounds great, I'm retired, I was a gym teacher""
B: ""I need a job and will put my yacht up for rent. I could teach.""
A: ""Sounds like a good plan, what would you like to teach?""
B: ""Economics would be my first choice.""
A: ""That sounds good, I bet you'd be a good teacher.""

A: ""Watching was documentaries, how about you?""
B: ""I like cooking shows. I should probably take some classes to improve.""
A: ""What was the most beautiful country you have visited? Or at least give me your top 5, I would like to hear it.""
B: ""My favorite region is the Caribbean so I would say top five are Jamaica, St. Lucia, Aruba, The Dominican Republic, and Barbados.""
A: ""Wow, you've really seen a lot of the area! I've been to the Dominican Republic, but haven't been to any of the others yet. But now that I'm retired, I'm hoping to take more vacations - especially cruises!""
B: ""Yeah, cruises are the best. It's like two vacations in one. The trip there is a vacation and then when you dock, you have another vacation exploring the country.""
A: ""True. Not to mention all the food you can eat! And an on board gym to balance it out...haha. I've got to stay in shape because sometimes I still substitute teach if they need someone for the gym classes. ""
B: ""Yeah, lol. There is nothing worse than a gym teacher that is out of shape. I'm thinking about teaching economics online so I can still travel the world.""
A: ""That's a great idea. Would you be able to teach from your yacht? I'm sure the students would love to see that!""
B: ""Yes, I can teach from my yacht because I have a satellite internet system installed. As long as the weather is great I can get online and my yacht would serve as motivation for them to manage their money well too.""
A: ""That's so true! I'm sure you'll be a great economics teacher because you've lived it, and have so much real life experience to share. And telling about all the places you've gotten to visit will be motivating as well!""
B: ""So, have you seen any good documentaries lately? I have a Netflix subscription that I watch sometimes in the middle of a trip.""
A: ""Have you seen Dawn Wall? That one was amazing. It made me want to go to Yosemite! You'd have to find another mode of transport besides yacht though...""
B: ""No I haven't seen that one yet, but I've seen Free Solo, which is about a similar subject so I think I'll like it.""
A: ""Have you applied to teach economics anywhere?""
B: ""Not yet but I am considering my options. Have you seen any good war documentaries recently?""
A: ""Yes, I have seen a few and I have rewatched a couple that I have found really interesting over the years. Do you have any upcoming travel plans?""
B: ""No plans at the moment, I want to sort out my teaching platform first. But once that's done I will start planning for real.""
A: ""Okay, that is so nice that you will be able to teach from your yacht! You will still be able to travel all over the world.""
B: ""That's the plan! I love the carribean but can't wait to travel to Australia and the Maldives ""
A: ""I have always wanted to go to both of those places, I really wish that I would take more time to travel.""
B: ""Won't you have time to do that now that you are retired? ""
A: ""Yes that is what I am hoping for but I always seem to make an excuse for why I can't go. I really need to make it a goal.  Have you tried any new food recently?""
B: ""Oh, I went to this new fusion restaurant, it was indian-chinese! Interesting combination but it was delicious! Quite spicy. How about you?""
A: ""We recently got a new hamburger spot in town. They put anything you can imagine on their burger but I just stuck with what I usually get. The burger was still very good.""
B: ""You're making me hungry. I haven't had burgers in ages. ""
A: ""I am thinking about traveling across the USA.""
B: ""Really? why the sudden interest in travel?""
A: ""Oh, I've been thinking about it for some time. I'd really like to see some of the National Parks.  I definitely want to include Yosemite on my trip.""
B: ""That sounds exiting. Any states in particular you want to visit?""
A: ""Well, there are a lot of National parks in the western part of the country.  Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, etc. I think I'll rent an RV.""
B: ""That sounds like a good idea. I know there are some nice parks around Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Virginia?""
A: ""Yes, I've been to the Smokies, and the Everglades. I think I'd rather travel further west this time though. I've never been west of the Mississippi.""
B: ""Western United States is extremely beautiful so i know your going to enjoy it.""
A: ""Maybe I'll even get to the Redwood forest!  Have a lot more time on my hands now. When I was working I could only take short trips close to home.""
B: ""I have never been but i have seen pictures in textbooks and it looks very cool.""
A: ""Yeah, I've always been impressed. I think I'm going to start taking two vacations a year. One in the states, and one abroad or in the Caribbean.""

B: """"Who Knows"" featuring Chronixx. It's a really cool song.""
A: ""I'll give it a listen to when I have the chance. Have you had any troubles recently with your work in the convenience store?""

A: ""I finally checked out Protoje. You were right! He's great! Can you recommend some other artists you like?""
B: ""Ah, what a great artist. I really like a lot of his music. I also like Jesse Royal when I'm listening to that type of music. I can send you my playlist!""
A: ""Ah fair enough, he's a man though and I don't listen to male artists! I think I saw you working in the store last weekend - do you know if you guys managed to get any organic vegetables in this week? ""
B: ""Fair, I'm sure there are plenty of great female artists too. I just think of the vocals like an instrument in the mix rather than a gender. We get our shipments on Tuesdays. So come early Wednesday morning for the good stuff!""
A: ""Yeah I understand, but I feel that the music industry is just too male orientated so I want to show support to just females ya know! Great news, I'm glad you guys finally got on board with the Organic food, I can't stand the taste of the mass produced stuff! Did you see the new electric car that came out last week, I definitely think you should replace your Nissan with this one! ""
B: ""I have to agree with that, support diversity on all fronts where you can. Hmmm I haven't. I was thinking about electric. I don't drive it very far and I think it'd be a good idea. Who makes it?""
A: ""It's made by Honda, so it's still Japanese which is good, and seemingly reliable :) If you had a charging station at your house it would be perfect - especially if it was solar powered!! ""
B: ""I was looking at solar panels too. We still have some good tax credits here, but I get a decent amount of shade. Who installed yours? I'd love to have a few, even if they only end up accounting for a bit of my power. Was it expensive to install yours?""
A: ""It did cost a little bit to set it up, I can't remember the name of the company to be honest, i'll have to have a look and let you know! Apparently it takes about 5 years to recoup the cost, but then it starts paying you for your energy! All the frogs legs you can cook without having to worry about the power you're using ;) ""
B: ""Haha, yeah I'd be a good long term investment, and probably increase the value of my house as well. I'd appreciate that yeah, gotta start going green. ""
A: ""I rarely use any power now anyway, since I stopped shaving my body hair keeps me warm - I can even use my armpit hair as a scarf when it gets too cold! ""
B: ""Wow, that's intense. What do you do in the colder months?""
A: ""There's a green energy expo downtown this weekend you might want to check out!""
B: ""Oh, that's excellent. I want to talk to some installers to check prices for solar. Did you find it difficult to choose your provider?""
A: ""I did a lot of research and i found out that the tesla solar panels are the cheapest and the ones that look the nicest.""
B: ""That's interesting. I figured they would be the most expensive ones out there. I guess I haven't really done my homework!""
A: ""They are extremely affordable and they save alot of energy. ""
B: ""Are you planning to come by and get your veggies this week? We just got lots of interesting greens, and some wild-looking carrots.""
A: ""You already know it i am making chicken soup this weekend so i need to find the freshest veggies.""
B: ""I'll set aside some onions for you as well. We didn't get any new red onions this time, as I heard a big corporation is buying up all the red onions in the area, but we have some nice yellow ones.""
A: ""Dang it, red onions are my favorite for the soup. Its okay though i can skip out on the onions this weekend. How is Taylor Swift like?""
B: ""She was kind of a regular person, you know? I thought she would be a snob, to be honest, but she was polite and smiled a lot. Have you ever met anyone famous?""

A: ""it is going well, I am going to easily do the marathon. Maybe not a good time but I will complete it. I thought that sailing was hard work? Does it not keep you fit?""

B: ""The older ones do, and I think the youngest will start in a year of two when they're able.  It certainly makes things easier being able to take them all to the baseball diamond and just letting them play on their own.  Organizing their team practices on the other hand is a nightmare...""
A: ""I can't even imagine trying to coach little ones!  How old are the ones you coach? I remember when mine were little and played sports!  The attention span was awful!  They'd be in the field picking flowers while a ball rolled past them!""
B: ""I've coached ages ranging from 6 to 11.  There's definitely a lot of variability in terms of skill.  Some of them are really into it and very talented, others can struggle to pay attention.  It's always a crapshoot what the team is going to look like.""
A: ""Do you think that your sons and their baseball team would make a good subject for your photography?""
B: ""I take pictures of them at their games and practices.  Every now and then I can capture a movement that is awesome on film.""
A: ""That sound's good. I imagine a good action shot would look great as a big canvas or something.""
B: ""I think so.  Have you thought about getting back into painting?""
A: ""Well I have been considering photography - there is alot of amazing street art near me and I think they would make great prints. Any tips for me?""
B: ""Lighting is important but just having fun with it is more important.  Keep clicking until you get the shot you like.  What is the street art about?""
A: ""There is so much of it and it's all very different. There is a whole part about climate change near by with gorgeous scene of wildlife and nature. What is your favorite thing to photograph?""
B: ""Oh that sounds lovely.  I love to photograph nature and the sort of stillness in it.  Sunrises, a butterfly on a flower, things like that.  I will take a photo of anything though, always have my camera with me. My boys always make fun photography subjects. Have you heard from your children?""
A: ""I think to start out I should try to photograph lots of different things to see what works! Unfortunately not, I was hoping they might call this weekend but no :(""
B: ""That's a great idea.  When we get together this weekend, you will get a feel for it.  Oh, that's a shame.  They may be busy, have you tried calling them?""
A: ""Yes, I am looking forward to getting all your advice! No, I normally always phone them but I get the sense  it's an inconvenience so I don't bother anymore. ""
B: ""Oh. I am sure your not an inconvenience.  But I understand always being the one to call...people seem to forget a phone call works both ways. Was thinking we could get something for lunch this weekend...what do you like to eat?""
A: ""Were you able to go out and photograph this week? I hope your boys are doing well!""
B: ""I did go out to do some photography, but fell and broke the lens on my camera.""
A: ""Oh no! I have heard they are expensive. I hope it isn't too much to replace it.""
B: ""It was my telephoto lens that I just got. It was quite expensive but I had purchased the insurance so should be able to replace it without out of pocket costs.""
A: ""That must be a relief. I would feel so bad if that happened to me. Can you work with other lenses in the mean time?""
B: ""I can, but was excited to get some new shots of things that I haven't been able to capture before.  There is an eagle nest with eaglets that I am trying to photograph.  Can't do it without the lens that I just cracked!""
A: ""That must be disappointing. Do you develop your own photos as well?""
B: ""I would love to develop my own photos, but with five kids, I don't have enough rooms in the house for a dark room.  ""
A: ""That is true. Do your boys also enjoy photography?""
B: ""Nah, they enjoy sports and videogames.  Shocking right??""
A: ""Hahha. Do they play on any organized teams?""
B: ""Hmmm, that is an interesting question...I organize their team practices, but I can assure you they are not always organized.  Sometimes it feels like I am just corralling cats.""

B: ""I play music. I'm going to be a rockstar.""
A: ""I hate drugs and don't drink either what kind of music do you play?""

A: ""I'm sorry but I don't think you ever told me your name.""
B: ""My name is cletus huckleberry. Nice to meet you.""
A: ""I recently went to a great cafe that just opened that features local bands.  It is nice to go there instead of a bar in the evenings.""
B: ""Its good that we agree on the live music scene! I just wished the crowds didn't drink so much beer there!  What kind of music did they play?""
A: ""Typical coffee-shop music, some acoustic stuff. It was pretty good. I always prefer live music. Yeah, it was nice to be at a cafe where it was mostly coffee and smoothies! How have your bagpipes held up? Have you still been playing those?""
B: ""I hurt my lips on them last week so its been collecting dust for a few days. I plan on getting back soon though and play some new songs. Do you think the cafe would like my bagpipe playing?""
A: ""Oh no, I hope you feel better soon! I think they would honestly. They're looking for local artists to build community and get their own name out there so you should definitely look into it! It's definitely unique. Do you write all the music you play yourself?""
B: ""Thanks for the feedback! Its hard to find gigs that like Scottish metal played with a bagpipe. Sure, I write all of my own music. Have you ever heard of ""Shake your Bum Bum""? That is one of mine.  ""
A: ""It's definitely unique, but interesting enough to get people's attention. I haven't heard it, but I'll have to look it up! I'm always impressed by people who can write their own music. Hey, maybe the cafe will pay you enough so you can start saving up to move out! How is that process going?""
B: ""Well, the folks have been getting a little tired of doing my laundry.  They said they love having me live in the basement but last week I cam home and the locks had been changed. I had to climb in through a window. Whats up with that?""
A: ""Whaaat that's crazy! Have you asked them about it?""
B: ""They said they didn't know anything about it. What is really strange is they still haven't given me a new key. Maybe I could crash on your couch?""

B: ""I have been craving a good folk concert, with acoustic or just a small band. Thanks for the news. Curious what kind of music, or band you may be thinking of? ""
A: ""He's an acoustic guitarist, from what I understand. Plays in the style of Jim Croce. I love Jim Croce!""
B: ""Classic, Jim Croce. Now I have one of his songs going through his head, ""Time in a Bottle"" - kind of a haunting song, you think?""
A: ""Yes, I think Time in a Bottle is one of the most beautiful songs ever!  Croce did a lot of story songs too.""
B: ""I sure hope he was paid for his writing. Actually maybe I should research who wrote Croce's big hits. Do you like to sing? ""
A: ""I think he wrote most of them himself.  I envy someone with that talent!  I like to sing.  Other people don't like me to sing! haha""
B: ""I hear you there! hehe. My grandma used to laugh and say, ""You better be good, or I'll sing!"" She wasn't much of a singer either, but she sang loud sometimes. ""
A: ""Can you sing? Not that I can imagine you can sing while playing your bagpipes, but I mean in generaL""
B: ""Actually I love to harmonize with other singers, love to have just voices, or a cappella. Love simple melodies and harmonies. ""
A: ""So do I!  You do have a fair amount of musical talent!  writing, singing, playing an instrument.  I wish I could do any of those!""
B: ""It mostly is, for feeling good or just getting emotions out sometimes. Especially those old ballads, really can work through things. Performers need an audience too, like you ""
A: ""I was able to make a reservation to the cafe two hours ago to see the acoustic guitarist. I was wondering if you wanted to come along, I'm sure you will enjoy the atmosphere of the event, and the food at the cafe is pretty good too.""
B: ""Oh, that is great! Is it an all-ages event? Only because I am only 19, so I want to make sure I will be allowed in.""
A: ""Yup!It is at a cafe and not a bar so all ages are welcome I think it would be just up your alley. ""
B: ""OK, perfect! What kind of music does this guitarist play?""
A: ""They are very foksy which is why I thought of you. I've heard them do a cover of our favorite Jim Croce song.""
B: ""I hope they play it at the cafe! That would be such an experience to hear it together and sing along. I think it would be a very special moment.""
A: ""Me too! I was wondering have you ever played your bagpipes in front of a crowd?""
B: ""I haven't played in front of a crowd. It is actually a big dream of mine but I have such bad stage fright and I worry I won't be good enough and that everyone will laugh at me.""
A: ""Well if you ever want to start with an audience of one I can be your guniea pig. ""
B: ""I appreciate that! How about we get together before we go to see the live show?""

A: ""Nice, I've been focusing on Python.  I think I want to be a data scientist for a sports or entertainment company and I think it'd be a good entry language for that.""
B: ""Oh okay. With your sports background, I think you'd be a shoo-in for a position in that field. I'm primarily looking to do freelance work because your skills are all that matter, not if you have a degree from a fancy university.""
A: ""Yeah that makes sense, especially if your mom is going to make you stay in India.  Has her mind shifted on that at all?""
B: ""No, she is very desperate that I stay in India because I'm her only son and she depends on me. Also, she is afraid I will face discrimination as a foreigner in America.""
A: ""Dang, maybe you can get her to compromise and let you try living somewhere like Hawaii.  It's great here and not nearly as far from India as the mainland states.  Lot's of different demographics here too, I doubt you'd see any overt discrimination.""
B: ""That's a good idea. The warm climate would be a plus as well. I experienced snow once on a trip and I wasn't a big fan of it.""
A: ""Yeah the weather here is amazing, it's one of the best tings about Hawaii! Unless you decide to go way up near the top of the volcanos you'll never see snow either.""
B: ""Yeah, and I imagine there would be lots of places to practice my swimming. I'm more used to pool swimming, but I would love to practice some open water swimming.""
A: ""Why do you want to work with Apple products?""
B: ""Apple is one of the most innovative companies in the world. Not only would it pay well but I'd love to help design iPhones and other products.""
A: ""It does seem like a good job. I imagine it has really strong job security, I don't think iPhones will be going anywhere anytime soon! ""
B: ""I don't think so either. You mentioned that you created music recently? Maybe you could get some of that on iTunes one day!""

B: ""I do actually. I like to hike as well. Going for nice walks is a great past time as well. Nothing would ever top swimming for me though. What about you? What do you like to do outside school?""
A: ""I did track when I was younger. I still run and since I moved here, I've learned to surf. I'm having a lot of fun with it! It took me a long time to pick it up though.""
B: ""Despite loving the water and swimming, surfing is not something I really got into. Tell me how it was. I've always been curious and wondered if it was worth trying. Not to mention, some of my swim students also surf.""
A: ""Have you ever tried skateboarding? It's a lot like skateboarding in that the main thing is learning how to keep your balance, only at least in surfing when you fall it doesn't hurt! The equipment can be expensive but when you're first starting out a lot of bigger beaches will have surf outfitters where you can rent everything you need for the day, and they usually have someone to give lessons too! ""
B: ""Well I might have to give it a try. With me being a swimmer, if I fall off, I would surely be okay. I did skateboard when I was younger but I had a small accident and kind of moved away from it. I'm a bit more interested in surfing thanks to you.  Any tips you can give me?""
A: ""Hmm. Well, the way I started off was on a 'boogie board' which is sort of like a surfboard only you rest your upper body on it instead of standing. If you get a good wave with it you kind of feel like Superman! That kind of gets you used to what you have to do and how to move a flat board to maneuver around the wave.""
B: ""It does look like quite an amazing rush! My students and I went on a trip once to the beach. A couple of them were showing off their surfing skills. They tried and tried to get me to do it. I didn't however and told them no. Now I may be able to surprise them once I learn how. I appreciate the help!""

B: ""Maybe I can teach pluto abc song! I want to be a dog just like him!""
A: ""You can! That would be fun. How old are you little doggy?""
B: ""I do not know, what do you mean? Do you like chocolate?""
A: ""I just found out I am going to Disney next week. I can't wait to get some candy.""
B: ""That sounds exciting! What kind of candies do think you will get this time? Also, will you bring some back for me to try?""
A: ""I like licorice and salt water taffy. Do you like those old fashioned candies ?""
B: ""I enjoy almost any type of candy. So, are the licorice and salt water taffy the special candies that you get in Disney World? As long as its not chocolate, you should bring some back for me to try.""
A: ""Ok, do you want me to Bring you some Pluto themed toys ?""
B: ""That would be awesome! I can pay you for them. I don't want it to be a burden on to you. Do you think you'll bring back some Mickey themed toys for yourself?""
A: ""I think I have enough Mickey stuff, but I now that I will buy some more. I think I will have to give away some of my Mickey toys to make place.  Do you want some ?""
B: ""If you are going to get rid of them, I would be happy to take them. I have a niece who would love them. I think she would be very happy to have a few new toys. ""
A: ""That would be my pleasure. I like to know that they will be still be appreciated. Do you keep all your Pluto toys ?""
B: ""Of course! I have a bit of a Pluto shrine going between all the toys, shirts, and other general paraphernalia related to Pluto. I assume you do something similar for you Mickey gear?""
A: ""There are some items that I keep, but I like to have a rotation. So I never need more space and I still have new stuff. Do you think you will need more space for your collection ?""
B: ""If I keep accruing more Pluto related items, of course. I don't intend to get rid of any of my stuff related to Pluto. I do like the idea of decluttering my space by getting rid of some of my Pluto items but I just can't do it. I take pride in my collection.""
A: ""Maybe I should look into selling my Mickey Mouse items.""
B: ""Honestly now might be a good time to sell, lots of people seem to be interested in childhood collectables lately.  Do you need the money?""
A: ""I want to buy more Mickey stuff but I really don't have the space for everything so that's why I was thinking of selling.""
B: ""Ah, that makes sense! I've got the same problem.  I'd love to have some new Mickey toys, but I've got so much already and I can't bring myself to get rid of anything.  Do you know what you might sell?""
A: ""I'm not sure yet. I need to sit and go through everything before I decide. I think I should also look at the prices things are currently selling for?""
B: ""Yeah that's what I'd recommend.  If I were going to sell I'd look online to see which of my items would sell for the highest prices and focus on those.  I love all of my collectables equally, so I'm okay selling off just the highest price ones and keeping the rest.""
A: ""Yes, I get that. I really want new things so I don't mind selling some. I will need to do that this weekend before I go to Disney next week. ""
B: ""If you need any help researching what to sell just let me know, I love this kind of stuff!  It's so exciting you're going to Disney too, anything new you want to see this time?""
A: ""That's great, thank you. I'm not sure , I think there is a new ride which I haven't been on yet so that's exciting. I generally don't have a plan when I go. ""
B: ""That's cool, sometimes a big part of the excitement is just walking around and exploring to find what's new rather than relying too much on other peoples' advice.  It's really fun to just immerse yourself while you're there.""
A: ""Definitely I love just walking around taking everything in.""
B: ""I need to go to Disney sometime, it's sad that my parents haven't wanted to take me and I can't find anyone else to go with.""
A: ""I really enjoy my Mickey Mouse hats, what are some of your favorite collectibles?""
B: ""Oh my gosh I love the hats too! But I really really like the figurines oh oh and I have a snowglobe with mickey in it!""
A: ""Wow, I will have to look for them when I'm there. What else do you like to collect?""
B: ""Well I really like Pluto stuff too. Have you ever collected any of those? I have a watch with Pluto in it and his arms move around the clock!""
A: ""I prefer Goofy to Pluto, actually. Did you ever see him sing the song about sailing? It's so fast, and I still want to learn the words.""
B: ""I don't think I have. Man I really want to go to Disney. You are so lucky!""
A: ""Maybe you can go sometime this summer after all. I'm sure your parents would let you go if you offer to help them with things.""
B: ""I wish. I tried so hard but they just don't to go. Grownups! What is your favorite thing to do there?""
A: ""I just like seeing the characters. They are really fun to get pictures with. Did you ever meet any famous characters before? Or people?""
B: ""No not really. I saw a guy once at the grocery store with my Mom that was on tv in our town. But nothing huge. Did you?""
A: ""That's really cool. Was he on the news? I saw the guy from Breaking Bad once at a store too. I didn't talk to him though.""
B: ""No he did a commercial for a store in our town. He wasn't really famous I guess but he owned a chocolate store or something. I hate chocolate!""

A: ""Thank you so much. It is all about clean eating and being self aware""
B: ""Makes sense, you'd be a good role model. Any children?""
A: ""No, not yet. Do you?""
B: ""Yes, a new little one on the way too""
A: ""I started my job and I am loving it so far.""
B: ""That's awesome! So you have clients already? How does it work exactly, do you meet with them in person once a week or so?""
A: ""I don't have a bunch of clients yet as I only just started. But, I have a few and am starting to build up a portfolio of clients. Generally speaking, I keep in contact with them via E-mail or phone and do a weekly or bi-weekly meet up to make sure they are on the right track. If you want to try it out, I can get you scheduled with me or another agent for a free month trial.""
B: ""Oh that would be awesome! I'd totally try it for a month. Not sure if it's for me but there's no harm in giving it a shot. Especially with the baby coming soon, I need to make sure my life's in order""
A: ""I think it would be good for you! I'll speak with one of the other people who work here about setting up an appointment with them to get started. How soon until your next child is born? If its soon, I can try to schedule for your first appointment to be after that.""
B: ""It's not due for another 4 months, so I'd be happy to get an appointment sooner! I have a kayaking trip I'm busy planning for right now, but maybe in 2 weeks if there's something available?""
A: ""That sounds good. I'll look to see if anyone has availability to add a new client in two weeks. ""
B: ""Nice! What did you do before being a life coach? It seems like such a perfect fit for you ""
A: ""I was a part-time athletic trainer. I feel like my experience as an athletic trainer is what landed me this job. I know that the people interviewing me were impressed by my previous work history. I had done all kinds of different sports and general athletics related to it. Ironically enough, I actually have never been kayaking though!""
B: ""Ah that makes a ton of sense, they seem like similar jobs at least in some respects. Encouraging people and helping them meet their goals. You should totally try kayaking! It's super versatile, it can be relaxing on a lake or thrilling doing whitewater""
A: ""I've always been interested in Kayaking but never really had the opportunity to get in to it. Do you think you could help teach me a bit and maybe we could go on a day of kayaking together?""
B: ""Yeah that would be so fun! It's really easy honestly, there's a bit of skill with steering but once you get the hang of it it feels super natural.  ""
A: ""Turns out I have a new client that also likes to kayak. I told him you were going to teach me how to do it. He said he would give me pointers as well! ""
B: ""Are you sure you want to do it? I can definitely teach you the basics if you are willing to go with me on my next trip.""
A: ""Yeah definitely! I feel like water sports are the final frontier for me when it comes to athletics.  It also seems like a great way to forge bonds with clients.  How late in your pregnancy do you expect to keep kayaking? ""
B: ""I'll keep going until I feel like I can't do it anymore. So, who knows really? Anyway, do you want to start out kayaking by doing something calm (like a lake) or should we aim for a river with rapids?""
A: ""Hmm, do you think it'd be easier for me to learn the techniques in calmer water?  Or is it better to jump straight to rapids since that's where I want to end up eventually? ""
B: ""I think it would be better to start out in calm water. Once you have been able to practice the basics for a bit then we go to moving water. I think you'll be fine though. ""
A: ""That sounds reasonable, I definitely want to make sure I really know what I'm doing if I'm going to be kayaking with this client later on.  It'd be a bad look for me to not have the fundamentals down before I meet with them.""
B: ""Did you ever get your kayak that you were talking about buying? If not, I have one that you can borrow for the trip.""
A: ""I haven't bought anything yet, I was going to hold off until I tried it first to make sure I could do it.  It'd be wonderful if you'd let me borrow one!  Are you sure it'll fit me? Haha""
B: ""Yeah, it'll fit you no problem. I suppose it's a good idea to wait. You don't know yet if you are going to want a kayak for calm waters or for rapids. ""
A: ""Okay cool, do you know which calm lake we can go to?  I'm not very familiar with the places around here that allow kayaking.""
B: ""There is a pond/lake up by where my trip is going to be. It's also not far from where the river is located. It'll be a great time!""
A: ""I found a kayak for a cheaper price that I am going to purchase. I don't need to borrow yours anymore.""
B: ""That's awesome. Where did you find the kayak?""
A: ""I found it in the Facebook Marketplace. There are a lot of interesting things there.""
B: ""Interesting! I will have to check on there. I have a lot of baby things to buy soon.""
A: ""There might be some there! Babies are so exciting. Do you have everything planned yet?""
B: ""Not quite, but it's not my first go round, so hopefully it will be easier this time. I'm not looking forward to giving up the rapids, that's for sure! Have you got any professional advice for people who need to give up something they love for a while?""
A: ""My best advice would be to find something else that really interests you and try to put more focus into that. It's easier to give something up, if you have something else to replace it.""
B: ""That's a good idea. After the baby is born, I'll be super busy, of course, but the last few months of the pregnancy are sure to be a little boring. Maybe I'll subscribe to every streaming service there is so I'll never run out of shows!""
A: ""haha There you go! Disney+, HBO, and Netflix are my favorites at the moment. DO you subscribe to any right now?""
B: ""Just Netflix, but I heard good things about Peacock. Oh, and I got Apple TV free with my new phone, and I want to watch that show Ted Lasso. Have you seen it?""
A: ""I have Apple TV with my phone, too. I don't use it often, though. I have not seen that show yet! I haven't had a lot of time for tv lately.""

B: ""Are you in school too?""
A: ""No. I finished in 1995. What year are in?""
B: ""First year, I just moved here with my best friend for school too.""
A: ""Its great to have friends. I hope you look after each other that's very important""
B: ""So true! So what do you do for a living?""
A: ""I'm in mining but I hate it. What is your field of interest""
B: ""Aside from nursing, I work at a bar to pay for school.""
A: ""Bar work can be fun. You learn so much about human nature. Thank you for caring about others""
B: ""Of course, it is like a live sociology class too.""
A: ""Absolutely!! The subjects are already prepped with truth serum""
B: ""I definitely agree! Good perspective. Why do you not like mining?""
A: ""Today, a wall almost collapsed on me and my crew. The danger is one of the reasons I really don't like the mining field.""
B: ""Wow, I've never had anything like that happen to me at my bar. Is everyone okay?""
A: ""People are mostly ok. A few minor injuries but everyone got out in time, no broken bones or, god forbid, deaths. I might try to get out of this line of work soon, these kind of incidents just keep happening ""
B: ""I'm so sorry to hear that, but I'm glad everyone is mostly okay. Have you thought about going back to school? It's tough to work and to go to school, but I hope it will be very rewarding.""
A: ""Yeah, it's just been so long that I'm not sure it'd work for me. I'll think about it for sure. But I might end up doing a similar job that has less hazards, maybe construction or outdoor work. How's school going for you? ""
B: ""That's a good idea too, I hadn't thought about it but a change of industries might just be right for you. I don't have a lot of free time between my job and schooling, but it's going well, thank you. It's frustrating to not have much time to do the things I would like to do anymore.""
A: ""That completely makes sense, it must be pretty stressful. Are you in any clubs, maybe a band or choir?""
B: ""Oh, I wish, that sounds like a lot of fun. I'm a little shy and only recently moved to town for school, so I'm not involved in any activities at the moment.""
A: ""That makes sense. It could be a good way to meet new people! Since they'd share at least one of your interests. But I get that time management is super hard on top of a job. How do you like working at the bar? Any crazy customers?""
B: ""Yeah, definitely! I'll look into clubs around here. Obviously, bar work isn't nearly as stressful as your job, but you do occasionally run into some very rude customers. On the whole, I really can't wait to get stuck into my nursing and get out of the bar.""
A: ""Makes sense, I was a waiter a long time ago and even though some customers were perfectly polite, it was always the rude interactions that stuck with me ""
B: ""Exactly! You can spend your whole shift with the nicest customers, but one person can ruin your entire workday. I guess you just have to pick yourself up and move on in that scenario.""
A: ""So it turns out that my company is under investigation for unsafe working conditions, as of tonight.""
B: ""Uh oh, so what happens to the mine while it's being investigated? Do you still need to go in to work?""
A: ""Operations are shut down pending an internal investigation. I have no idea when we'll be able to return to the site.""
B: ""Dang, that sounds really serious.  Are you still getting paid?""
A: ""Not from my company, I'll have to file for unemployment benefits. I'm going to take this time to look into school as well.""
B: ""Ouch, I guess you can take this as the sign you needed to get a new job though.  Any ideas what you want to study?""
A: ""I'd like to get a masters in mechanical engineering. I have all my basic classes completed already.""
B: ""Wow, that sounds like a pretty lucrative field to get into.  Will your work experience at the mine help you with it?""
A: ""Yes, it most definitely will. Especially when it comes to knowing the schematics and machinery that we use in the mine.""
B: ""That's good.  I wish I could say that same about nursing, my experience working at the bar hasn't helped my studies at all, hahaha.""
A: ""Are you sure, taking care of patients and customers! lol""
B: ""I guess you can say that, though if my nursing patients end up being like my bar customers I think I might be getting into the wrong field!""
A: ""How much longer until you finish nursing school?""
B: ""Hopefully just a year more! How long would your master's take?""
A: ""Probably about two years. That's still something in the future for me. I'm trying to sort out what to do right now. How are you liking school?""
B: ""I'd like it better if I didn't have to work, too. Would much rather focus on school. How about you? Will you work while taking classes?""
A: ""I think that'd be a good idea. Half and half, if I can. I guess it really depends on class schedules and what jobs I can find. Do you have friends to study with?""
B: ""A lot of people want to study together, but I'm not actually into that. I need to be able to focus if I have any hope of remembering anything! I take it you like studying in groups?""
A: ""I think it depends on the subject. I think some subjects are easier with a group and some are easier on my own. Do you have time for any other activities besides school and work right now?""
B: ""You mean like sleeping and eating? Barely. Anything else just feels like more work! I don't even keep house very well right now. Hopefully there will be time to clean after the semester ends.""
A: ""Aw, hopefully. That will be a nice break. What do you like to do when you have free time?""
B: ""Just listen to music and read, usually. Calm activities away from other people. As you can see I'm not a people person! How about you? What do you like doing?""

B: ""i have been thinking about it, it does sound like a great idea but i have to think about the money and how much it's to cost. i also Volunteer at the dog shelter sometimes so maybe i could get one form there. Do you know what the best breed of dog is for someone like me (old and slow) ""
A: ""I was talking with a friend an hour ago, and they told me their Great Dane is very calm and quiet. I think that would be a good dog breed to consider if you plan on getting one. Hopefully the shelter has one that you can adopt.""
B: ""Those seem like nice dogs, however they are extremely large from what I understand.""
A: ""They are quite big, but if it behaved well; would it be that big of a problem? What other breeds would you consider adopting? I've noticed that most smaller breeds are more stubborn.""
B: ""I think it may be a problem because since I have retired, we have downsized into a condo. I don't think that would be fair to a big dog to confine them into a condo. I was looking at one called a Shetland Sheepdog. Do you know anything about that breed?""
A: ""I don't really know much about Sheepdogs, no. I know they're gorgeous animals, though. I heard they're easy to train as well, but I have no experience with them. Is that the dog you're looking into getting? No other options?""
B: ""That dog really appealed to me, but I am open to other options. Do you know of any small breeds that are not stubborn? My wife wants one that with snuggle on her lap. ""
A: ""I think all small dogs tend to be stubborn. I haven't really heard of any that aren't. They tend to be quite yappy and have a bigger attitude than their body. Haha. They all seem to be harder to train. Maybe if it was mixed breed with a less stubborn dog, then it would be easier? I'm not sure. German Shepherd are pretty well behaved dogs. They're not as big as Great Danes either. ""
B: ""I absolutely love German Shepherds but my wife already said no to that. I think we will have a hard time compromising on this one. Maybe we should just get a cat instead haha...kidding! ""
A: ""I don't have cat and never have. I would definitely probably want to get a cat if anything were to happen to my dog. I heard they're very low maintenance. Might be perfect since you're retired!! Haha.""
B: ""Ok maybe that is a good point. But I don't know if I can really walk a cat. Part of the reason I wanted to get a dog was so that it would force me to get outside and walk every day. I have a step contest with my local retirees in the condo building.""
A: ""I think you wouldn't have too terrible of a time walking a cat if you get it while it's younger. Just do it everyday and often and it should get used to the harness or collar you use. It'll be harder if they're older I assume. ""
B: ""Yes, I don't really see people walking cats in my neighborhood. I feel like my fellow veterans would laugh and make fun of me.""

A: ""Hi what do you do?""
B: ""I go to school. Hate it! Will you be my friend?""
A: ""Sure! You can be friends with my 3 dogs too if you aren't allergic""
B: ""Oh, I am not! I am only 12, though. Will they like me?""
A: ""I think they will. All of them are friendly! Whats your favorite subject?""
B: ""I do not like school at all. And gym is the worst!""
A: ""I'm always walking my dogs so gym activities are fun for me""
B: ""The boys pull my waist length red hair. That hurts!""
A: ""Aww that's not very nice of them. Have you told the teachers?""

B: ""Okay, thanks! What do you like to do?""
A: ""Well I like working in my dog walking business! Dogs are the best""
B: ""Better than kids, that is for sure!""
A: ""I remember back in school the other kids would always be annoying""
B: ""Especially when you are 12! How old are you?""
A: ""I got a new client - the cutest little dog you have ever seen. I think it is has some Chihuahua in it. You should see it trying to keep up with my German shepherd!""
B: ""What a sight that must be to see! Walk them by my house so I can see them!""
A: ""I have a walk at 5pm today. Will you be home then?""
B: ""I will! Perfect! I can't wait.""
A: ""How is school going? I hope it has gotten a little better.""
B: ""Last week was brutal, but this week has been mild. I try to make the most of the good days and not dwell on the bad ones.""
A: ""That is a very healthy attitude to take on it. Kids can be so cruel. Keep your chin up!""
B: ""I have gym class next period and I am dreading it. We are playing dodgeball.""
A: ""I always hated gym class too. I am not athletic at all. I always stood right up front for dodgeball so that I got out asap!""
B: ""Great tip! Thanks for the trick!""
A: ""I will see you later. The dogs are sure to cheer you up!""
B: ""I am looking forward to it. Off to dodgeball :(""
A: ""I have a lot of new clients. I am so  happy!""
B: ""That sounds exciting.  Have you come across any interesting breeds in your dog walking business?  I am curious because I am thinking about getting a new dog myself.""
A: ""I really like Maltese dogs. They are so tiny and cute. But they can be expensive to buy. Labs are nice if you want bigger. Will your parents let you get a dog?""
B: ""Yes my parents are actually in favor of it.  It will be a therapy dog of sorts because of the trouble I am having at school.  They think it will improve my mood and reduce my general anxiety.""
A: ""I am so sorry that boys are making fun of you. Don't listen to them. Things will get better. A dog will make you feel good. They give you such love.""
B: ""I appreciate that and hope things will get better for me as well.  I like your idea of getting a Lab, I think that breed would suit me well.  The question now is whether I should go to a shelter and adopt an older one or get a puppy.""
A: ""From my work with dogs I would highly recommend you adopt. There are so many beautiful dogs that need homes. You can literally save a life. Then they will be your best friend. You can also get a young dog from a shelter, especially a lab.""
B: ""I think I will do that then.  I was just somewhat hesitant because I feel like I am letting down all of the other dogs that are also at the shelter.  Even though I am helping one dog, I feel guilty that I am not capable of helping all of the dogs that I see there.""
A: ""Have you looked at the websites of any shelters near you to see what dogs they have in at the moment?""
B: ""My mum keeps telling me about about a shelter close, but most of them are grown up and I want to get a puppy. ""
A: ""Grown-up dogs can be easier to handle, though. Puppies like to chew on everything, and older ones are often more calm. Maybe consider it? They need homes too!""
B: ""Yes, I know they do. But, I think getting a puppy to begin with would be a good start and then when I am more confident, I can rescue them from shelters. ""
A: ""Perhaps. Do you have much space to keep a large dog?""
B: ""We have a really big garden. Also, I would be more than happy for it to stay in my room, not sure how much my mum would be happy with that though. ""
A: ""That's a good point. Sometimes they could bring fleas into the house, or even ticks! It's good if the dog can have its own bed at least.""
B: ""Really? Are the transferable to humans? I would be scared if I got them ""
A: ""Well, fleas can bite you but I don't think they stay on you. Ticks are a bigger problem because they can carry Lyme disease. I have a friend who got that and she said it's pretty serious!""
B: ""Oooo that sounds serious. I am sure if I was to get a dog from the rescue center, they would have made sure that they don't have fleas or ticks, right?""
A: ""Oh definitely! But you have to protect them with special collars or some drops you put on their skin. Usually you have to use the drops once a month. I'm sure the shelter even sells the drops, but you could get them at any pet store. And don't forget to buy a good leash!""
B: ""I have seen videos of people being pulled over by their dogs when they have them on leashes and the dogs want to run. I am scared that will happen to me and I will get hurt!""

B: ""Yeah, barnaby is a keeper and a great scorpion spotter. I hate scorpions.""

B: ""Barnaby found one in my dad old nascar cars right before I sat down.""
A: ""Ugh. I do not think I could live with them.""

B: ""Lol, yes but cute! I can't wait to meet him and take lot's of pictures.""
A: ""You can probably bring your paints and do a painting of the horse. I know I am going to have my camera with me and take some pictures.""
B: ""Yes, that's a great idea! I'll bring all my painting things with me. Does Saturday work?""
A: ""Yeah, that sounds great I am free all day.""
B: ""Awesome! Sounds like a plan then. ""
A: ""Indeed I am looking forward to it I know it will be a lot of fun.""
B: ""Oh yes! I haven't rode a horse in months, I'm very excited!""
A: ""Do you have any other painting work lined up at the moment?""
B: ""Yes. Someone commissioned me to paint a seascape. I can't wait to get started!""
A: ""That's fantastic.  Is this for a private client or for a public space like a mural?""
B: ""It is at a school. I can't wait to inspire them. Do you display any of your photographs anywhere?""
A: ""Sometimes I post them online.  And sometimes I'll frame photos I really like, or photos of horses I really like.  But mostly I just take them for myself.  When I'm finished training a horse for someone I'll sometimes give them a framed photo of their horse if I have a good photograph of it.""
B: ""That must be a great gift for them! I think they would really enjoy it. You should consider selling some. It can be a great way to earn extra money.""
A: ""I never thought of that, but that's not a bad idea.  When you get commissioned to do a painting, how have your clients usually found you?  Word of mouth?""
B: ""At this point people will share my info with others. When you are starting you can tell people about it. You can leave flyers at ranches or wherever. Make an ad online.""
A: ""That's a good idea.  I'll have to try to do that.  Every dollar can help since school is expensive.  Is your seascape going to be oils or water colors?  And how large a painting is it going to be?""
B: ""I like oils. I like the texture that you can get with that. This one is very large. But I have done things of all sizes. What size are your photos?""
A: ""I like to get them as big as I can while still keeping the clarity, of course.  My camera is pretty good so I can take print pretty large photos and still keep them quite sharp.""
B: ""A photograph can really be a work of art. Do you manipulate them after or what you take is the final product? I am always changing my paintings around.""
A: ""If you have the interest, I would love to commission a painting of my dear Sirius.""
B: ""I would definitely be interested in that! Does your dog sit still well?""
A: ""He can sit still... on a good day. Can you work from a photograph?""
B: ""I can. Both animals and children can be tough to get to sit still. haha""
A: ""Sirius has a mind of his own and can get a little unruly at times. But I think I can get him to pose briefly for a portrait. What size would be best for you?""
B: ""It doesn't matter to me. It depends on how much you want to pay. haha On my end, size doesn't make a big difference. I can make from tiny wallet-sized to large wall-sized.""
A: ""I'm talking about the photo. How about an 81/2 x 11, letter-sized, landscape? I think it will give you sufficient detail to do the painting. As for the painting itself, I'd like something I can hang on my den wall, say poster-sized..""
B: ""Okay. That will do. After you give me the photo, it will probably take me around a month to finish the painting. Is there a particular date you need it by?""
A: ""No, please take your time. Sirius doesn't care about time all that much, and I have my other work to do. I'll get the photo to you this Friday after work if that's OK. ""
B: ""haha I'm glad you have a patient dog. Okay, that sounds fine! I will get everything set up and go through my supplies.""
A: ""I know it's probably hard to anticipate cost at this point, but can you give me a ballpark figure?""

A: ""Phones nowadays have such good cameras and they are very portable and easy. But, no doubt a Canon DSLR is much better when you know how to use it! ""
B: ""That's true about bigger cameras -- it takes a lot of practice to get the right exposure and focus. A phone usually does all that for you! But it seems like you're a natural photographer based on your shots. You have the most important thing, which is a good eye for framing!""
A: ""They are super expensive too. But then, I guess phones are expensive too. Thank you, I am such a harsh critic of myself because I always want to get the perfect shot.""
B: ""It's a good thing phones can do so many things besides being cameras, although I have to admit I like upgrading my phones mostly for the latest camera technology. It's an indulgence to replace a phone so often, but it's amazing how much better they get each year.""
A: ""I sometimes think that companies purposely don't upgrade their phones as much as they know how to in order to facilitate bringing out a new phone. And, that consumerism is, in a sense, stopping technological advancements because companies are trying their hardest to maximise products and monetise technological advancements""
B: ""Well said! I do feel pretty consumerist when I want the latest phone, although I treat it as my only major point of greed. I rarely replace other things I own. In fact the shirt I'm wearing is one I've had since high school!""
A: ""Everyone has their indulgences, I believe they are big parts of our personalities. Does the shirt have any sentimental meaning to you, or is it just one that has maintained quality for years?""
B: ""A little of both, actually. It's a Smashing Pumpkins shirt, but it has also lasted a long time. They just don't seem to make clothes to last anymore. They fall apart so quickly now, unless you buy really expensive stuff.""
A: ""Again, I think it is part of the business model. They make products to have a certain lifespan and therefore they need replacing, whereas years ago they were much more bothered about their reputation - companies, that is.""

B: ""I think you should still contact them. If someone disowns you just for getting in trouble when you're young, they're not a very loyal friend. Lots of people get in trouble when they're young. And if they love films as much as you do, it could be a good way to reconnect with them.""
A: ""I will get in touch, I'm just afraid they don't want to do anything with me anymore. Even though some of them shoplift just like I did, but didn't get caught. ""
B: ""Don't be scared. In life, sometimes people won't want to be your friend because they judge you, but that's fine, you wouldn't want to be friends with someone who would judge you negatively either. When things go wrong, that's when you find out who your friends really are. The important thing, no matter how old you get, is to use your experiences to improve yourself.""
A: ""Good advice. How old is your daughter, by the way? Is that the kind of stuff you tell her?""
B: ""She's 10. As a parent of course you try to give your kids good advice, but mostly they don't take it. As they say, 'a lesson merely heard is never a lesson learned!' Everyone needs to make their own mistakes and learn from them.""
A: ""I agree, just hope the mistakes aren't too bad. Are you still trying to switch schools for her?""
B: ""Yes, but it's not that easy because I'm also trying to change my job at the same time, so I have to do lots of things at the same time. I think she could get a better education at a different school but of course it's harder to get your kid into a good school.""
A: ""How often do you bring your daughter to the park?""
B: ""I take her on the weekends alot when it's not too cold. She enjoys the park a lot. ""
A: ""I really miss visiting parks. There here a little green space at the detention center, but it is not enough. I am looking forward to getting out. ""
B: ""Do you have any idea when you may be getting out?""
A: ""It will be a little while. They are very harsh here in Texas. But it will happen. One day I could be a dr like you.""
B: ""Yes you could. You are still young and you have your whole life ahead of you!""
A: ""I hope so. I also want to have kids one day like you do. It must be great.""
B: ""It is nice. It's like having a friend who is also a mini version of yourself. I wouldn't mind having another.""
A: ""How many do you want? I want a lot of kids one day. And they won't go to jail.""
B: ""Maybe just one more. I don't want too many kids because I still want to live comfortably, both financially and mentally haha""
A: ""They are expensive. First I need to get a job to earn money. ""
B: ""Have you thought of any jobs you'd like to have when you get out?""
A: ""I just asked and was told I will be here for one more year. What do you think the first thing I do when I leave this detention center should be? ""
B: ""I would go and see your mum and thank her for visiting you. Then go and have the best meal of your life.""
A: ""You're so right. If I had money I'd take Mom out to dinner but that'll be hard. Guess it will have to wait till I can earn some money.""
B: ""That is fine, you can make it a goal to keep you track and something to aim for.""
A: ""Yeah. I wish I could make some money on a computer or something. Like fill out surveys and stuff. I can type fast, I think.""
B: ""It might help to get you started but I am not sure if it will give you a long term income. You could always try some free online courses to gain some skills?""
A: ""Yeah, but I don't know if anyone will hire me for a normal job. I've heard it's real hard especially if you don't have work experience. Do you ever work with people that were in detention before?""
B: ""We all make mistakes at point in our lives. Many people are willing to allow others have a chance to improve if you just have a go. Maybe try some volunteer work while you are doing some online work? This way you can demonstrate that are suitable for normal work.""
A: ""Yeah maybe. I could work with kids and help them not make the mistakes I made, you know?""
B: ""That would be a great idea. Not only will it help you but think about all the other kids you might help avoid detention. ""
A: ""For real. It is so horrible here. I wouldn't wish it on anybody ever.""
B: ""If you have learnt from your mistake then it is not completely wasted.""

A: ""Yes, I do like my new home I just get a little home sick at times. I defiantly miss Germany.""
B: ""How long have you been in America?""
A: ""It's been a little less than a month, so I'm still adjusting but it's been challenging! ""

B: ""PIZZA!!! ... what kind of toppings do you like?""
A: ""Mmm, so yummy! I love banana peppers on mine! What's your favorite topping?""
B: ""all meat is my fav!  with extra pepperoni. Hey,,,, the banana pepper reminded me of the stretchy banana you joked about regarding escaping me from juvi ... Escaping is such a temptation but I keep reminding myself that it is less than a month now""
A: ""I am getting my house all set up.  The last of the boxes are unpacked.""
B: ""That must feel so great to be almost completely unpacked!  What state did you end up moving to?""
A: ""For now I'm in California. I moved here because I'm a pro disc golfer and needed to be closer to the pro tour action. My sponsor suggested I move here so that I can play more and make more money at it.""
B: ""That makes sense.  It must be nice to live somewhere with such gorgeous weather!  Do you have any family or friends in the state?""
A: ""Only the people that I know from disc golf. I'll make some more friends along the way I'm sure. Yes, the weather is pretty nice here and much different than where I'm from in Germany.""
B: ""I bet there are lots of other differences from Germany besides just the weather.  What other differences have stood out to you the most?""
A: ""The way people act and drive is really different. The food is also quite a bit different. There are also a lot of differences in how things are laid out and organized here vs Germany. I feel like it's pretty chaotic here, but I'll just have to adapt.""
B: ""I think even people who are native to America would agree that California can be a bit chaotic haha!  What do you think of the food?  Better or worse than the food you are used to in Germany?""
A: ""I haven't had a chance to try much in the way of food. There just seems to be such a focus on fast food here, which I don't really like. Hopefully, I can find some good restaurants that have better food.""
B: ""California has a wide array of restaurants, and there is a big interest lately in healthier options.  I'm sure once you explore the area a bit that you'll be able to find some grocery stores and restaurants that are a bit more appealing.""
A: ""I've found the grocery stores to be very similar to Germany, only the brands are different. I've found Aldi here, which is a Germany chain.""
B: ""I never realized that!  I feel like Aldi definitely has a cult following...I've never really been that impressed with it though.  I wonder if the quality of Aldi stores is different in the states versus in Germany.  I feel that here, a lot of people like to shop at Whole Foods.  Have you ever been?""
A: ""So what are your plans once you are released from juvenile detention? ""
B: ""I am hoping to be able to travel and find somewhere to build a new life with opportunities where my past can be forgotten. Any suggestions?""
A: ""Have you finished high school yet? GED?""
B: ""I have finished high school and I actually have really good grades. I just got involved with the wrong group of people and ended up doing something silly. My best subject is Maths.""
A: ""Then you need to go on to university! You can probably get a work-study stipend. STEM is a great field to work in right now.""
B: ""Hopefully they take my background into account when considering giving me an offer, and not just my silly mistakes. I really do want to go to university. I just worry that I will be judged because of what I have done in the past""
A: ""I don't think you even need to mention it. In Germany, juvenile records are protected and confidential. I think it's the same here. I believe university administrators are mostly concerned about academic achievement. If you have any legal problems as an adult, the adult authorities will deal with it.""
B: ""Oh okay, that is reassuring, thank you! My academic records are pretty flawless because I love learning. I am definitely going to apply to university. Maybe I should use my time left in this detention to sort out my application, could I email you if I have any problems?""
A: ""Absolutely! I'm not a rich person, but If I can help in any other way--time and energy--please let me know.""
B: ""Yes, that's what I meant. Just the know-how and some questions about what they might be looking for me to include in my personal statement etc. Did you go to university?""
A: ""Yes I did. Heidelberg, for medicine. I'm attached to a hospital in San Francisco as a neurologist.""

A: ""Yeah, maybe I could learn something about horses, like therapy with horse. I have not been on a horse since September, I miss it very much. ""

A: ""I don't really feel I know them, so I can't say I like them.  But I do sometimes get amused observing them.  How they dress, what they buy, what they drive, and how they act.  It's very impersonal though.  But I like to guess what I think they'll buy when they enter the store.  Who'll buy cigarettes?  Lottery tickets?  Health food or junk food?  That kind of thing.""
B: ""LOL,,,, I bet that makes the shift go faster. Do you go back to the farm and have lots of animals to care for after yous shift is done?""
A: ""No, I moved off a farm last year and into an apartment.  That's why I haven't been on a horse in months.  I like having my own place but I miss the open space and animals.""
B: ""Oh. I bet that's closer to work, anyway. You mentioned that you want to color your hair. What color do you want to dye it?""
A: ""I was in a pretty bad mood when I told you that and was thinking about dying it whatever color would most annoy my boss.  But now I'm thinking something less extreme that still expresses my gloomy mood, like jet black.""
B: ""Jet black can look exotic. Does your work limit you on being able to dye your hair or have tats or piercings.?""
A: ""There are no formal rules but the boss gives people a hard time about those types of things.  I usually try to keep him off my back and look presentable but he's been more annoying recently so I sort of feel like riling him up intentionally.""
B: ""haha,,, that made me snicker. I wanted to dye my hair bright pink. I suggested it to my dad and he just gave me that ""look"". So I will wait. I do wonder how acceptable it is for a lawyer to have pink hair. What do you think?""
A: ""Are you thinking about becoming a defense attorney, and if so what kind of cases would you be interested in taking. Would you consider becoming a prosecutor?""
B: ""I think I'm more interested in corporate/property law as a career overall, but I might work as a prosecutor or public defender for the experience.""
A: ""That sounds tough. I guess corporate pays a lot more, but it's less interesting. Do you think you'll be able to have pink hair and be a lawyer? Never seen that before!""
B: ""Heh, the legal world tends to be a bit conservative, so probably not. But while I'm in school, I don't see why I can't.""
A: ""True! You should definitely go wild while you can. Are there a lot of people at your school with hair like that?""
B: ""Not many. Blue, but not pink. I'll have to give all of that up once I pass the Bar.""
A: ""That sounds pretty hard. So much reading involved! But in the end you can be like one of those lawyers on Law & Order!""
B: ""Hollywood law? Nah! Real law practice isn't as exciting or glamorous. Mainly it's a lot of research, writing, reading, and filing documents with the courts.""

B: ""Very cool, do you grow anything else in your garden?>""
A: ""the usual's. like tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, green beans, lettuce, strawberries, blueberries.""
B: ""Awesome, I wish I could grow things. I have an apartment, but maybe one day when I have my own house. ""
A: ""You should look into doing container gardening if you have a spot that gets sunlight. there are actually quite a few things you can grow indoors too.""
B: ""I know nothing about this, do you have nay good resources to get me started?""
A: ""I would suggest finding a local nursery and asking the employees there. they are very knowledgeable and you can even buy everything you need there.""
B: ""I will look into that, thanks. How is your health?""
A: ""It's not so great. but that's to be expected. I can at least feel content that I got to live a good life so far. though I do wish to see my grandchildren grow more. even if they are brats sometimes. ""
B: ""I am so sorry to hear that. I think you have a great outlook though. Do you know how much longer you have?""
A: ""doctors said anywhere from 6 months to 1 year. so I'm just trying to live every day to the fullest right now. ""
B: ""That's all you can do I guess. I wish you all the happiness over your remaining days. ""
A: ""Have you looked into starting your container garden?""
B: ""I have! Got some seedlings in my windowsill and keep moving them out when they're big enough. How's your garden?""
A: ""It is going pretty good. I am hoping that the strawberries come in ok, I sometimes have birds getting after them.""
B: ""We get a lot of birds in our garden too, do you get netting to protect your fruit? ""
A: ""I need to. I just need to get a frame built to put it over. Do you have any suggestions?""
B: ""I just use some bamboo canes with netting attached for mine. You still feeling able to get out and do much or have you managed to talk the kids into helping?""
A: ""Ha! They really don't want to help. They will eat the preserves and salsa I make, but don't want any part of the care and upkeep. How are the rabbits doing?""
B: ""Haha, sounds like most kids. Still plenty to look after. People come to adopt them, but feels like two arrive for every one we rehome.""
A: ""I guess they multiply like rabbits! Lol. Do you ever adopt any of them?""
B: ""I do take some home. That's why I decided to do some container gardening. Easier to stop them from eating everything when they get out!""
A: ""I bet that would be a hassle. Rabbits can be really cute, though. Maybe I'll come look at adopting one!""
B: ""They are really cute! I'll bring some over sometime soon for you to spend some time with. They're quite therapeutic when they're on your lap.""
A: ""How many rabbits do you have at home now?""
B: ""We have about 30 Rabbits now and a few of them are pregnant so we are expecting more pretty soon!""
A: ""That's so many rabbits! How do you guys have enough to feed them all?""
B: ""Thankfully, the rabbit rescue has been getting a lot of donations recently meaning that we have a surplus and to stop it going to waste, the volunteers are allowed to take it home with them ""
A: ""Your apartment must be so big to be able to fit all those rabbits! I have a lot of produce from my gardens I could give you for your rabbits!""
B: ""The apartment has a shared garden, and the other residents don't mind me having them in the garden, They love them. What type of produce do you have?""
A: ""I started growing carrots! I also have some crunchy fresh cucumbers if rabbits eat those. I remember bumping into one of the residents the last time I visited! He said something about seeing rabbits in a shipyard container??""
B: ""They LOVE carrots and cucumber. I am sure they would be grateful to be given some. So, thank you! Yeah, one of the residents works with me at the shipyard. and we found some rabbits in one of the containers when we were emptying them. I have no idea how they got there, but given my volunteering, I thought it was quite the coincidence. ""
A: ""I would love to feed them sometime soon! That's interesting haha for a second I thought you might have been breeding and shipping rabbits!! ""
B: ""Noooo, not shipping them, or breeding to be honest. I don't have the space for any more, even the babies that are due to come. I will need to see if some other people want to keep them. Would you be interested?""
A: ""I would love to have a rabbit or two to care for! Unfortunately, I will not be able to take care of them for long!""
B: ""Any relief would be great. It would give me some time to find some permanent homes for them. At the minute, it seems like not many people want rabbits, but I am sure I will be able to find some people to lighten the load for me ""

A: ""Nice, I play the violin. I try to get a three mile walk into my day.""
B: ""Violin, oh my gosh! My father was a pro violin player and he showed me a lot!""
A: ""Wow! Did you ever consider violin? If I'm not practicing, I usually unwinding with a book""
B: ""Yeah I actually play the violin, guitar, drums and piano.""

A: ""How was volunteering at the homeless shelter? Do you plan on learning any other instruments?""
B: ""It was good.  I feel like the time I put in there actually helps someone.  There are so many homeless people out there now that shelters like the one I volunteer at can use all the help they can get.""
A: ""Maybe when the kids get bigger they can help out. Right now they volunteer at the pet shelter, but that is just because pets are not as sketchy as some people are. I want them to be old enough to know basic self defense before letting them work with adults. ""
B: ""That is a good idea!  There are some people out there for sure that would hurt a child.  What about you?  Do you do any volunteer work?""
A: ""I help with the PTA and we do bake sales and food drives for the famililes in the school that need assistance and cannot get any. It isn't much, but last year we were able to help a single mother get new tires and a radiator with the funds we raised to help her be able to keep her job. It was a good feeling.""
B: ""That is really impressive!  Every bit of help anyone can do for another counts.  Have you been playing your violin lately?""

B: ""No violin lately. I've been busy with piano lessons.  You'd be surprised just how many people out there are wanting to learn to play now! ""
A: ""Oh no, I do know. My daughter wants to learn it, but every time we pay for lessons, she goes for a few of them and then just stops. ""
B: ""Really?  Why is that?  Is it that she doesn't like the piano or she isn't connecting with the teacher?  ""
A: ""We have tried 3 different instructors and she is always excited the first day and then by the third or fourth lesson she says it is impossible to learn, her hands are too small and she can't stand anything. It is heartbreaking. ""
B: ""Oh no!  You tell her that that is not true! Her hands are not too small! She can definitely learn how to play.  Why don't you let me give it a try and see if I can get her interested in playing?""
A: ""I spoke with my daughter about what you said. She said she'd like to meet you about the piano lessons. ""
B: ""Oh, perfect. I am free all of next week in the evenings. Is that something that works well for you two?""
A: ""That would be great! Hopefully we can come by Thursday. Do you offer lessons for both violin and piano at the same time?""
B: ""I can do, yes. My father will be around on Thursday too - I am sure he would be more than willing to help with the Violin. He is so passionate about it""
A: ""I'm so excited! I'm a big fan of your father's work. How has he been lately?""
B: ""He has been well. Managed to fall up the stairs the other day and banged his knee, but that doesn't affect his violin playing thankfully. How are your parents?""
A: ""Oh no, make sure he's more careful! I haven't talk to my dad since the divorce and cheating, but my mom is doing great now with her new man!""
B: ""Hopefully he treats her better. She really is a loving person and she deserves it. I try my best to help him, but he refuses to succumb to using an assistance stick. He will just have to at some point.""
A: ""He seems great too. They both visit and spend time with the kids regularly, much more than my dad ever did! Parents can be so stubborn sometimes haha""
B: ""As they always say to us, ""Do as we say, not as we do"". No matter how old I get, he still maintains that mantra. At this point, I am used to it. That is such great news! I am sure that will continue, I am certain of it.""
A: ""Thank you for your support! Has your father found anyone new? It's been some years, but that's okay if he isn't looking for anyone too.""

B: ""Cool what did you win for?""
A: ""It was in the 100 meter dash! I got 7 seconds!""
B: ""Wow!! I just run on my treadmill lol""
A: ""Nothing like a good exercise!""
B: ""Yes and I love the rower machine""
A: ""Row row row your boat gently down the stream, when you see a crocodile...""
B: ""Lol nursery r h y m e s""
A: ""I ran into a friend just two hours ago, and I heard they were selling an old rower machine that they no longer use. I think you would be interested in buying it off from them, would you like to get in contact with them?""
B: ""Oh, that's awesome, thanks! I'm a bit low on money right now, but I'm definitely interested in buying it a bit later. Do you know the price they're asking?""
A: ""I believe they are askign $100. If you think you can buy it, I bet they would work out some kind of payment play or layaway option. ""
B: ""That sounds extra cheap... I know that they're your friends, but still. Are you sure it's in a working condition?""
A: ""Yes, I swear by it. They don't really care about making money off it, they just want it out of their house. Let me know if you are interested. ""
B: ""Then sure, I am interested, that's basically free considering how expensive rower machines are. Thank you a lot! How are your cats by the way?""
A: ""They're good. I think one has a stomach bug though, I'm going to have to take her to the vet. How are your dogs?""
B: ""Oh, you should. I don't like going to vet but my pets' health is worth it for sure. They're great, thanks for asking :) I've started running in the morning and taking them both with me, it's so fun!""
A: ""I bet they love that. Running outside is so much better, especially if you have fun companions. Have you tried to hike with them?""
B: ""No, not yet... They don't really like going out, which is weird I guess haha. I'll try to take them with me when we go hiking next time, thanks!""
A: ""That is strange, lol. Well maybe it's not for them. I wish I could take my cats out, but I think people would give me strange looks. ""
B: ""It doesn't matter what other people think, don't worry! Just take your cats out and see if they like it, in the end it is all that matters.""
A: ""How are you finding the rowing machine? Is it helping your exercise?""
B: ""Yes, I'm quite happy with it.  It's in really good shape--better than I expected--and I like having it at home to use when the weather outside isn't conducive to running.  So thanks for facilitating the purchase for me with your friends!""
A: ""I'm so glad you are liking it!  I remember when I was training for the olympics, I had to run outside no matter what the weather was.  It's great to have an indoor alternative!  I still like to run, but not when it's too hot outside!""
B: ""Yes, I'm sure that for Olympic training there's no choice but to forge ahead, regardless of how you feel or what the weather's like.  Was 1992 the only Olympics you got to compete in?""
A: ""Yes, I'm afraid so.  I ended up with an injury in 1993 and that pretty much ended my competitive career.  Now I like to coach other athletes such as yourself....""
B: ""Do you currently coach anyone you think has a shot at winning a medal at the Olympics?""
A: ""No, I just work with local athletes. I have to stay pretty close to home due to my cats, and especially now that one of my cats is ill. I'm really worried  about her.""
B: ""Oh no!  Has it not gotten any better?  I think you better take her to the vet if she hasn't started to improve by now.""
A: ""Yes, I've been thinking that. It's hard to take her out of the house but I guess I have to do it. Do you have a near by vet that you trust your dogs with?""
B: ""Yes, actually I do.  One of my dogs ate a rock one time and had to go to the vet.  I really trust them even though I've only been once.  Would you like their name and phone number?""
A: ""Wow that sounds scary!  Yes, please sendme the information if you get a chance. I'm sure if you trust the that they will be able to help me, hopefully without costing a fortune!""
B: ""Yes, I don't remember them being costing too much.  Of course I was mostly just glad that my dog was okay.  I'll have to look for their information though.  I'll get it to you as soon as I find it.  Have your cat's symptoms been getting worse?""
A: ""My cat that I was worried about because he was ill is getting worse.""
B: ""I'm so sorry to hear that! Do you know what is wrong with them or do you have to wait until you take your cat to the vet?""
A: ""I don't know, but she's an older kitty and has some chronic health problems.""
B: ""Oh, I can relate to that. One of my dogs is older and has diabetes. Do you know when you'll be able to take them in to the vet? ""
A: ""Later today for sure. She went off her food yesterday morning and still isn't eating yet today. She's drinking water, though, so it might just be something transient. Still, I don't want to chance it.""
B: ""That's very good that you'll be able to get them in today! I find its best not to wait, especially when they have chronic issues. Hopefully it's nothing serious!""
A: ""Hopefully! We'll have to see. My vet's a good guy, does a complete assessment, so I'll know more later in the day.  She's a sweet animal and I'd had to lose her.""
B: ""That's so great. It's so important to have a caring vet! I'll pray for your cat to get well soon! Why don't you tell me what the Olympics was like. Maybe that will get your mind off your worries.""
A: ""It was such an exciting time for me, really gave me an opportunity to excel in my sport. The training over the year before was the most difficult thing I've ever done, but it was worth every second!""
B: ""How often did you train?""
A: ""Daily, in the early morning and late afternoon, for two or more hours. Had to follow a strict exercise and dietary regimen in addition to the sprint training. Socializing was rare, because I was exhausted half the time, and my coach wanted me in bed at a decent hour.""
B: ""haha That sounds worse than living with your parents! I guess it really did pay off for you! What kind of exercises helped you with sprinting?""

B: ""Do you have any pets?""
A: ""I have a cat. His name is spook. What about you?""
B: ""I have a turtle. I named him leo""
A: ""That's cool. How did you get a turtle?""
B: ""My best friend got it for me. He lives across he street""
A: ""That was sweet of him. Do you like music?""
B: ""I like what barney sings!""
A: ""You may not know them, but the who is a great band!""
B: ""Daddy listens to them all the time!""
A: ""While googling some songs that Barney sings, I found that there are so many and even hour length Barney song compilation videos on Youtube. Amazing!""
B: ""I like watching videos a lot. I can always watch cartoons and Barney without asking. I want to see it!""
A: ""I can send the links to your mom so she can make sure they are okay first. but that's pretty cool that you can watch barney whenever you want to. ""
B: ""Okay, she told me I can decide what I watch now. So I can be my own boss now. I also want to watch the movie Pet Cemetery, like my neighbor friend. ""
A: ""I'm just going to take a guess that if you are someone who likes Barney, you probably are not going to like watching pet cemetery. I'll still send the videos to your mom and she can decide if you can watch them.""
B: ""Well, sometimes my mom is too strict and she doesnt let me watch what my friends watch. I dont think its fair and was thinking about sneaking to watch the pet movie. Since it has the word pet in it I should get to watch it.""
A: ""I think your mom is just strict because she knows about more things than you do. You should probably listen to her.""
B: ""I do listen to her. She tells me when dinner is ready and when its pizza I run as fast as I can to the table. I like to listen sometimes.""
A: ""that's a good start, but it's easy to listen when it's something you want to do anyways. ""
B: ""Ya, it is really easy to listen when she makes me pizza. Its easy to listen when she lets me do what I want to do.""
A: ""You should try listening when it's something you don't want to do. I bet they teach that on Barney. ""
B: ""I know that Barney always says to clean up your toys and be nice to your friends. I think he wasn't talking about my mom though. I am not sure? ""
A: ""My cat Spook did something really funny and I want to tell you about it.""
B: ""LOL what did Spook do? Did he spook you?""
A: ""He has been doing this thing where he taps his food bowl on the floor repeatedly when he wants to eat. It's so cute and so funny. I'm going to try to get it on video.""
B: ""Haha can you send my mommy the video? Cat is my favourite animal but daddy says no cat.  What is your favourite animal?""

A: ""Poor doggy. If you don't mind, what happened to him? Was he just old?""
B: ""Mommy said he was old and went to heaven because of that. How old is your kitty?""
A: ""My cat has been acting so funny today! Its like she's on a sugar high, but I didn't give her anything out of her ordinary diet. ""
B: ""Maybe someone has been sneaker her candy.""
A: ""That's a good point and very possible. Have you ever given your turtle sugar?""
B: ""Yeah, but he doesn't like it. Mom and Dad said I shouldn't have given Rex chocolate. He liked it though.""
A: ""Oh no, your dog can get sick if you give it chocolate. My cat likes gummy worms but they are not good for him. ""
B: ""Maybe she'd like real worms!  ""
A: ""Maybe so, but I'm not sure. I named Spook after a ghost. Where did you get the name Rex?""
B: ""He was born before I was.  Dad said it was because he looked like a dinosaur.""

A: ""you can pick whichever one you want. I don't know the sex of them yet though. and they will get to about 5lbs. you should look into getting a big rabbit hutch. they actually don't do very well in the small cages. not unless you plan to let them free roam the house and just use the cage for when you can't supervise. ""
B: ""Okay, I'll get the hutch.  I think I'll take one fawn and one black. That way I can have a variety.  Should I get them lettuce from the grocery store or is there something else I should feed them?""

B: ""I'll do that!  You know, I am kind of excited about getting them! I've been wanting a pet rabbit for a while now!  I watch videos of pet rabbits on You Tube and they are so cute!""
A: ""they make great pets! and you can litter box train them too!""
B: ""I didn't know that!  Is it hard to train them?  Having them freely about the house could be fun!  ""
A: ""it's not hard. definitely look up training tips though. they love to be a part of the family.""

B: ""I just got them.  They are so cute.  I really can't imagine eating them, but I'm the same way about deer.  I know lots of people eat deer meat.  What made you eat the bunnies?  Were they pets or did you have them specifically to eat?""
A: ""Yes, I had them specifically to eat but now I just have them as pets. Did you name yours?""
B: ""I haven't named them yet.  I want to name them something cute.  Any ideas?""

B: ""Wow! I can not even count that high! I have a pet though. Do you?""
A: ""No but I should I heard they're great companions""
B: ""Dad got me a german sheperd to help on the farm. Where do you live?""
A: ""In california but I want to move to france""
B: ""France is a long ways away! Will you drive there?""
A: ""No way I'd die on the way il fly there""
B: ""Do they let people as old as you on planes, mister?""
A: ""I'm visiting a shelter later today to possibly pick out a cat.""
B: ""That sounds great! Do you already know which one are you looking for or are you going to decide on the spot?""
A: ""Well, I am looking for one that is really calm and one that will let me hold it. I am hoping to know the minute I see it. I am open to gettin any kind female or male would work for me. ""
B: ""I remember my dad picking our sheperd, it was so hard. When you see a lot of cute animals and every single one wants to be adopted, it's hard to pick just one.""
A: ""Yeah, that is a pretty good point. What if end up getting two? I sure hope I can decide on just one. I dont want to trip on an indoor pet so that is my main concern too.""
B: ""Don't worry, I'm sure it'll be fine :) Are you going there by yourself or with someone to help you?""
A: ""I have a home health nurse who drives me places and helps me get around. She is really kind and is patient with me when I am movin slow. I was wondering if your dad still has his dog? ""
B: ""That's good, I'm glad that she will be there to help! He doesn't have him, I have him :) He got it for me as a birthday present. And I'm really grateful for that, best present ever!""
A: ""Dang, that is a good deal there. I am happy for you! It is nice to have somebody to take care of and to care about. When you hit my age someday, you'll find out a lot of people that you know pass away and it can get lonely.""
B: ""Well, that's just how life goes I guess, nothing we can do about it. I'm sure you had a lot of fun in your younger years, so there's no use to get sad now :) A cat is a great idea though, it will definitely help with the loneliness!""
A: ""Oh, boy, you got that right! I was lightening fast and a very hard worker but liked fishing more. I have some fish stories that would knock your socks off.""
B: ""Haha I sure as hell would like to hear them! A bit later though, gotta run for now, have something to take care of in the garden. I hope you will pick the best cat they have, good luck :)""
A: ""How is your garden coming along?""
B: ""It's coming along fine!  Everything is growing right on schedule.  All of this rain we have been getting lately has been great for it and it keeps me from having to spend time watering!""
A: ""That is really great! What kind of plants are you growing?""
B: ""I am growing tomatoes, yellow squash, okra, and bell peppers.  With summer fast approaching having some fresh vegetables around will make meals light and easy!  Hey, I can fed ex you some if you want when they are ready.""
A: ""That would be great, are you sure it wouldn't cost too much? Do you preserve any of your vegetables?""
B: ""No, don't worry about cost. I'll be glad to do it!  I do make salsa and jar it.  I get some cilantro, jalepeno, and onions from a neighbor in trade for some of my okray and squash.  Do you want me to send you a couple of jars?""
A: ""That would be awesome! I love homemade salsa, it always tastes better than store bought. How is your dog doing?""
B: ""He's fitting in and learning the ropes perfectly!  You know, he's really going to be a big help around here.  Have you gotten a cat yet?""
A: ""I am still looking. I have been checking out the local shelters to see if there's a rescue I can adopt. ""
B: ""Wonderful idea!  There's always a ton of cats and kittens at the shelters.  Are you looking for something specific?""
A: ""No, just one that seems to fit me. I think that if I see the one, I'll know. I just need to get out and start looking. Have you been able to train your dog?""
B: ""I'm working on it.  The main thing is to get him used to the cows and know how to handle them if necessary.  ""
A: ""I found a rescue cat that I adopted.""
B: ""Aww, that is great that you decided to adopt it. Did you name it yet?""
A: ""I've named her Fish! I went with my son to go fishing for an hour and we did not find anything. Just as we were heading back, this little cat appeared with a small fish!""
B: ""What a great story, I am happy you gave Fish a home! Has she been adapting well to being home with you?""
A: ""She is the cutest little cat ever. She has stayed mostly by my side these past few days and has been a great joy to have around. I hope I live long to care for her.""
B: ""I hope so too! Have you made any plans to move to France?""
A: ""I'm not sure I want to anymore. I'm too old to travel and here is where family is and Fish now! Do you plan to stay on a farm forwever?""
B: ""Yes, I did have dreams of moving when I was younger but as I get older I realized I wanted to be around family and help out on the family farm that I will someday take over when my dad retires.""
A: ""You are a very hard worker and I know your dad will be especially proud of you for taking over! You'll always have food to eat as well""
B: ""That is true, my mom is helping me to learn how to cook and store a lot of the things from the garden. I am thinking about opening a stand at the farmers market to sell all of the vegetables I am growing.""
A: ""That's a great idea, I would love to be your first customer! I will bring Fish along and my nurse. Hopefully it will be very close by.""
B: ""That would be great, I plan to join the local farmer's market so it will be very close. I will bring some of my homemade salsa just for you!""

A: ""What kind of games does Steven like? ""
B: ""Steven has been obsessed with Stardew Valley lately. Have you ever played that game?""
A: ""I have never heard of that game do you know what it about? Maybe it would be a good game to try at the game party I am hosting.""
B: ""Stardew valley has a multiplayer mode so it would be perfect for your game party. It is about farming, and you roleplay as a farmer who inherits their grandfather's farm.""
A: ""Wow that sounds awesome maybe I could make a menu around the game. Maybe some farm food. Do you have any suggestions of what else to have with the burgers? ""
B: ""Definitely parsnips and starfruit. Maybe some farm fresh eggs and demon mayonnaise to go with it. Do all 5-6 people eat meat? Maybe there should be vegetarian options if any of your friends are veggies.""
A: ""Maybe some parsnips but I don't think starfruit grows locally here. Yes there are some vegans in the group probably do some Impossible Burgers. Is it true that the Impossible Burgers are really popular at Burger King?""
B: ""i have heard they're very popular! something about how the impossible burger works well with burger king's flame broiled taste.""

A: ""I would enjoy having you and Steven come to my party. ""

A: ""That is nothing. What kind of video games do you like ? It is just to make sure that everyone will have fun at my party. ""
B: ""I love simulation games like The Sims. It's so fun creating characters however you want them to be""
A: ""Do you play RPGs ? It looks right your alley. You decide on how to solve quests. ""
B: ""I don't, actually. Maybe I should give them a try, they sound fun""
A: ""Yeah. But the most fun ones are very complex, you should try Disco Elysium, it is less combat oriented and the story is great. ""

B: ""Right now I don't work. I quit my job to go into the monastery a while ago and haven't found the need for a job as I get my basic neccessities taken care of here. So being a cancer survivor...wow! I'm SO happy for you! That's a scary thing to go through. ""
A: ""Yeah, even if the doctors told me it was a small cancer, I could not stop think about it. That is why I did learn about meditation in the first place. What event made you want to study meditation ?""
B: ""Cancer as well...a close family member was diagnosed in 2006. Thank God she has been in remission for about 14 years now, but the C word is scary, no matter what type or size. ""

B: ""Well it also is one of the riches salmon areas in the world! A lot of it is only accessible by boat or small plane, so it is very wild area as well.""
A: ""Salmon is my favorite food, and the oils in it is good for people with cancer or recovering from it! I bet eating it fresh is amazing. That sounds really cool. How is meditating going?""
B: ""It's been going good! I have did a few 8 hour meditation sessions last month. How about you? ""
A: ""I am trying to see how cold effects meditation, so if I move up to Alaska, I can see about any outdoor meditation. I even went as far as trying to meditate in a walk in freezer, but I kept getting interrupted. I am trying.""
B: ""Oh wow that is very interesting! I don't think you have to come as far as Alaska to find cold weather! Have you thought about places like North Dakota or Maine?""
A: ""Oh no, I already was thinking about going to Alaska. I just wanted to do some trials before going. I am also trying to do meditation with different oils and scents to see how they effect it. I find that peppermint and lavender are not good for meditation. One makes you want to get up and go and the other will put you to sleep haha.""
B: ""Nice! I go the minimalist route when it comes to meditating, just however things are in the moment. Where do you currently live?""
A: ""I live in New Mexico now, but it is not my final destination. I like to move around every six months or so to pass on some lessons and enjoy a different area. I want to see the entire world, one continent at a time.""
B: ""Oh wow I have never been to New Mexico. In fact I have barely been to many other states! ""
A: ""Ok I tried a quick meditation with lemon essential oil and it went great!""
B: ""That sounds lovely, Lemon and Lavender Essential oils are the best. Although Lavender smells great and helps with more things. The smell of lemon is just sometimes what you need. ""
A: ""I've not had much success with lavender.  how do you feel about vanilla?""
B: ""That is also one of the best smelling oils there is however it doesn't help much with healing. I usually use Vanilla if i just want to feel relaxed. ""
A: ""Sometimes relaxing can be the best way to begin to heal. I'm thinking of moving again.""
B: ""Yeah you're right about that one. Oh really, where are you thinking about moving too? ""
A: ""maybe to washington state this time. have you ever been there?""
B: ""You really do like to move. Do you think you will ever settle down somewhere or you just like to see new places too much. I have never been there i have heard great things though. ""
A: ""I don't know.  As long as I keep enjoying new places I'll probably keep moving. at least until I find one place that insists I stay.""

B: ""So how old are you kris?""
A: ""17, but feels older. How about you?""
B: ""Don't be so eager to grow up its not as fun as you may think""
A: ""I know but you get to make your own decisions""

A: ""When do you plan to organize your baby shower?""
B: ""I need to start soon. Are you available to help me, by any chance?""
A: ""I would be honored! Let's go together this weekend and get started!""
B: ""Great - thanks! I am thinking something blue and yellow since it is a boy.""
A: ""Do you want to incorporate animals? Shapes? Disney characters?""
B: ""I haven't gotten that far! You are giving me a lot to think about for this weekend.""
A: ""I have a long run scheduled for Saturday morning, so I will come by afterwards. Probably around noon. Okay?""
B: ""Perfect. I can have lunch for you. I'm sure you will be hungry after a run.""
A: ""That's kind, thanks! Yes, I am planning to do 10 miles, so fuel and hydration will be much appreciated.""
B: ""10 miles! I haven't that far total in my life! You are really amazing.""
A: ""Thanks for the support! I enjoy it. It keeps me thin and stress free.""
B: ""I might try to start running after I have the baby. I will need to get rid of this excess weight.""
A: ""I was talking to a friend an hour ago, and they said they would be excited to come with me to help you plan for the baby shower this Saturday. They have experience in planning for various events, including baby showers. I can send you their number if you want to discuss the baby shower with them in more detail.""
B: ""Oh that would be great, I would really appreciate that! I am still trying to figure out the theme. What would you and your friend like for lunch?""
A: ""Glad we could help! Something probably light, how about salads? How do pirates sound for a theme?""
B: ""Oh, I love salads! Do you both eat meat, just so I know what protein to add to the salads. Oh a pirate theme could be super cute! And we could have everyone dress up!""
A: ""Both me and my friend are both vegans. Glad you like that idea. We could even have some eye patches for people to wear if they wanted!""
B: ""OK I am glad that I asked so I didn't serve you a chicken salad! I am sure I can find some good vegan recipes. I love the idea of doing a photo booth and having lots of props like a parrot, or pirate hats!""
A: ""Photo booths are super cute. I went to a wedding that had one and it was a lot of fun. I like the idea with all the props!""
B: ""So fun! I am wondering if I should hire a professional photographer, or just make it a DIY photo booth where people take pictures with their phones.""
A: ""That's a good question. I guess it would depend a lot on the price. How many people do you think will come?""
B: ""It started out small but the list keeps growing with all of the aunts, cousins, friends, etc. I also haven't decided if I will invite all of the men in the family as well, or just keep it traditional with the women. Right now I am close to 50 people.""
A: ""50 is a good amount. I think the fancier we make the party, the more it might be better with a professional. Does your husband want guys there? Things can get ""rowdier"" with men there lol.""
B: ""He said we should invite the guys because then we will get more presents haha! I said I don't think it will work that way, because the men coming with their wives are not going to give extra presents. Also, I don't need more things, I am just excited to have everyone I love there to celebrate this new little addition to the crew!""
A: ""I found a professional photographer that is available the date of the shower.  She is reasonably priced too. ""
B: ""Oh great!  That would be super helpful.  I have to think about catering too...""
A: ""I'll send you the details about this photographer and you can tell me if it's a go or not. I don't know anything about catering. What do you think you are going to serve as far as food and drink?""
B: ""I think something simple.  Maybe sandwiches?  or the traditional family style chicken and pasta?  I guess I need to get the guest list in order first to know how many people we will be feeding.  Have you been getting ready for the big 10 mile run coming up?""
A: ""That sounds good, but yeah, you should probably get the guest list first. The run prep has been going great. I'm always running so it's not like I was out of shape for it or anything. Are you still going to start running once you have the baby? It would be good for you.""
B: ""yes.  I've been walking to kick start the weight loss and just to get my self healthier.  Any little bit helps, right?""
A: ""Of course! I've heard that walking is great for pregnant women. Any kind of exercise is good for you!""
B: ""I can build up my workouts too once the baby comes.  Sneak in a free online workout here and there while baby sleeps.  The internet really helps with that!  No need for a gym right away...""
A: ""You know, you could just make yourself a home gym. That way you can easily workout whenever you get the chance!""
B: ""Yes!  I've thought about that too!  I love the way I feel already and its just been a few workouts.  ""
A: ""That's great to hear. I think you'll feel even better once you start running!""
B: ""I should ask for a jogging stroller for a shower gift!  Take baby with me. ""

A: ""Hmm, now that I don't know.  Salem's Lot is a vampire movie and Poltergeist is basically a haunted house type show.  Salem's Lot is really scary but Poltergeist doesn't really get scary until late in the show.""

B: ""I agree, tea has been great for my focus and energy.  I love coffee too, but it makes me too jittery and it's hard to sit still and study when I drink it.  How about you?""
A: ""I think I'm too much of a tea person to bother with coffee. Basically, why waste the time trying some coffee when I could be drinking some Earl Grey?""

A: ""I've been doing research on what running shoes to get and there are so many options I can't choose.""
B: ""Let me see if I can help you narrow your choices down.  What are your criteria? I mean, do you want arch support,  cushioning, things like that.""
A: ""I think that running would give me time to think and compose my music without any distractions.  What do you mean by saying that you feel free?""

A: ""Probably I'm not allowed to go anywhere off my property without them.  I'll have to check out the skechers max and see how they feel.  I'll have someone pick them up for me and try them.  Is there anything else that you can think of that I will need?""
B: ""You'll need some good, thick socks.  You know, I was thinking being free when running. Running could be inspiring for you with your music.""
A: ""I was thinking that too, but I was feeling like it would at least make me feel like I could be alone for a while.  Even if I do have security running with me.  Have you ever tried the toe shoes?  I always wondered if they would be good for running?""
B: ""I tried them briefly.  There's just not enough cushioning and support with them for running in my opinion. They are like being barefoot.""
A: ""OH that wouldn't be good for running in the woods with sticks and stuff.  I will definitely stay away from them.  Thanks for the advise""
B: ""You're welcome!  Hey, when you are out there running maybe you could come up with a rock song just for me?""
A: ""I've started writing a rock song and I'd like to know what you think about it!""
B: ""I'd love to hear it.  What is the song about?""
A: ""It's about a guy that has had his heart broken. It might be too sad though. That's where you come in. Maybe you can give me some better ideas.""
B: ""What about if you make the first part of the song a ballad that laments the heartbreak, but then the second half picks up, gets high-energy and celebrates his freedom and ability to move on and hope for the future.  Sort of like a Bohemian Rhapsody in terms of having very distinct parts.  What do you think of that?""
A: ""That sounds pretty good! You should just write it then! So, how's the training been going for your 10k run in Boston?""
B: ""I'm been getting out regularly and running in the mornings.  I find that I have good ideas in the mornings while I run, which is a bonus.  When do you find your inspiration for writing songs?  Do they just come to you or do you purposefully sit down and crank them out?""
A: ""I think the ideas have to come to me first before I even think about writing anything. Sometimes they come to me in dreams, then I sit down and go from there. You know, one of these days I'd like to get into running. What motivates you to do these long runs? They seem so brutal.""
B: ""You get an endorphin rush after running for a while.  And for whatever reason your body just starts to love being in motion like that.  I also find it very liberating.  It's just me in my head, doing my own thing.  I have limits, though.  As I mentioned, I'm not into marathons.""
A: ""That makes it sound a bit better. Makes me want to go get some shoes and start running. I don't have any running shoes though. What do I look for?""
B: ""Someone at a good shoe store should be able to help you find something that works.  Get support, lightweight.  You can learn more about yourself and what you need if you look at the wear patterns on your soles.  That shows how you run and informs you of what type of support you need.  If you started running, what type of music do you think you'd listen to while you did?  Would you listen to your own music?""
A: ""Hmm, I never thought about what kind of music I would listen to. Maybe I won't listen to any music and some song ideas will come to me. Do you listen to music when you run? Are you allowed to do that in a race?""
B: ""If I'm going on a light run I do sometimes listen to music.  In a race or if I'm training very purposefully I don't.  I don't want to mess with my rhythm and focus.  But sometimes it's nice to lose yourself that way.""

B: ""Nice. That sounds exciting. Is there a season of sorts or does it go year round?""
A: ""There is a swim season, but for me I swim all year round. I also enjoy surfing.""
B: ""Surfing looks wonderful, but it could be to exhausting for me. As much as I like to swim I need to keep my heart rate reasonable. ""
A: ""That's understandable, maybe I could coach you on some techniques to lower swimming exertion.""

B: ""I like a simple acoustic guitar.""

B: ""Exactly. It is so versatile. What kind of music do you like?""
A: ""I really enjoy rock music. ""
B: ""I don't mind some of the softer rock songs. Anything too intense gets my heart pumping too fast.""

A: ""Yeah, thanks for the suggestion! We can learn together then. I hope you get it. The soft rock  you enjoy sounds great on acoustic guitars. ""
B: ""Yes, I think my mom will get it for me since she feels bad for me. I wonder what is a good song to be my first song to learn. Any suggestions?""
A: ""Maybe you could just move a guitar from the store to your house with your mind. Although I suppose that's ethically frowned upon. What era of softer rock? I quite enjoy Bryan Adams.""
B: ""I could definitely do that, but my mom tells me that is stealing. Bryan Adams is pretty good. I think Eric Clapton is a really good guitarist. ""
A: ""He's amazing. So is John Mayer actually. None of his mainstream stuff really showed his guitar talent so much. ""
B: ""John Mayer is amazing! I love the song Slow Dancing in a Burning Room. I listen to that alone in the dark in my room when I am feeling really sad.""
A: ""That song has always reminded me of my ex! Although I suppose that's it's intended purpose. ""
B: ""Yes, I guess so! I unfortunately don't even have an ex. Not a lot of people want to date a weirdo like me. ""
A: ""I think a lot more people than we realize feel that way about their self. Are you sad alone in your room in the dark often? I hope not. You are amazing. Sometimes it's harder to see from the inside, and I find that especially true of the very most amazing people for some reason.""

B: ""Yes, I'd like that. Maybe you can play some songs and impress both our dates haha""
A: ""LOL I can try! Where do you normally go on these blind dates?""
B: ""We usually go to local musical festivals. I just figured if they enjoy it, then at least we'll have something in common""
A: ""That's not a bad idea honestly. Plus there is plenty of people around since these are blind dates and you don't know much about them prior to these dates.""
B: ""Exactly, maybe for our date. We can head to a Rascall Flatts concert""
A: ""I managed to get four tickets for Rascall Flatts at the local arena in two weeks time. Now we just need to arrange the dates!""
B: ""Oh that's great news! do you have any ideas of who you will be asking to go with you yet?""
A: ""Well, it will be me and you and then we have to find some dates to bring! That's the tricky part.""
B: ""do you have any friends who have friends they'd want to set up on a blind date? ""
A: ""I will have to ask around. I am sure someone will be interested, if even just for the free concert tickets. And then we will win them over with our charm and dashing good looks!""
B: ""sounds like a good plan. I can't wait! even if the dates are bad at least we will still have the concert. ""
A: ""Exactly! I noticed that there's a fairground right near the venue, maybe we can go there before the concert to have some fun.""
B: ""that sounds fun. maybe we can go out to eat first too? ""
A: ""Yes, that is a must! What kind of food do you like to eat?""
B: ""mexican, chinese, italian... I'm not too picky honestly""
A: ""Ooh I love Mexican...actually I think there's a nice restaurant nearby. Tacos and margaritas before the concert? ""
B: ""that sounds wonderful. hopefully the dates agree""
A: ""Good news I found two sisters who said they will go to the concert with us!""
B: ""That's awesome.  How do you know these two sisters?""
A: ""On Reddit, if you can believe it! I was looking at Rascal Flatts fan posts and someone mentioned they couldn't get tickets and were disappointed, so I reached out. Lucky, huh?""
B: ""Yes, that's the power of the internet, I guess.  Are they twins by any chance?  Are we going to be able to tell them apart?""
A: ""Haha, not twins, I don't think. One of them is in college and one isn't, so I assumed they are at least a couple years apart. The younger one is studying music!""
B: ""Do you still want to try to get something to eat before the concert?  Or go to the fairgrounds?  It might be nice to get to know the ladies a bit before we get to the concert, though I'm not sure what their expectations are.""
A: ""Yeah, that would be a good idea. Mexican food! I didn't specify it was going to be like a date or anything, so I don't know their expectations either. We can get a sense of that over burritos first.""
B: ""Yes, I always find that burritos are a way to a girl's heart!  This is so exciting!  I'll have to pay you back some way for setting this all up.""
A: ""It'll all even out in the end, don't worry about it. I know you don't love Rascal Flatts so you are really doing me a favor, to be honest!""
B: ""Well, I think I should at least pay for the burritos.  I just got paid by the gas station so I've currently got some extra cash.  It might even make me look that much more impressive with the sisters!""

B: ""Thanks for asking! They're okay now, but I decided not to apply for the position. I'm thinking about trying to do some work online instead.""
A: ""That sounds like it might be a better option. What kind of work would you do online?""
B: ""I heard about how you can do things like online surveys or typing things out. I'm not a fast typer but it's less strenuous than cleaning, that's for sure. Do you think it's a good idea for somebody like me?""
A: ""I don't know much about it but it sounds like it might be less stressful than cleaning. Maybe do some looking around online to see what you can find out.""
B: ""Maybe if I do it, I'll ask your advice about investing in crypto like you mentioned. I worry it's just a fad, and I'm not getting any younger, so I need to be thinking about retirement savings.""
A: ""Yeah, none of us are getting any younger! I'm looking to get a new job myself. I'm sick of working at home as a vet.""

A: ""I would have to say Hugh Jackman he was such i nice guy. I was a stunt double for the greatest showman. ""

B: ""What do you do? I'm work for a watch dealer.""
A: ""No wonder you like watches! I'm a commercial electrician""

B: ""Not like that! I just have a rear view camera. And it beeps when I get to close to things, which is nice. Cars are getting so advanced. I am feeling left behind""

A: ""Not very far - a few hours - but I guess any distance at all seems like a big one to me!""
B: ""Yeah, I can see that. But as long as you can still drive to see them, I think you will be fine. When are you starting school?""
A: ""In September, if all goes to plan. But enough about me. How are the horses?""
B: ""They are great! I love spending time in a barn. We recently purchased a new stalion. His name is Macho.""
A: ""That's a great name for a horse! How many do you have altogether now?""
B: ""Right now we have 3 horses and a donkey.  You would love them.  You need to visit sometimes.  Being around horses is so destressing.""

A: ""How much does a PI cost these days? It's got to be less than the pony you just bought, right?""
B: ""First off he is not a pony he is a stallion. PIs are about the same as they were five years ago when I last hired one for a different issue. They are more expensive in NYC in general, but that's like anything in the city. Have you budgeted that into your move to the city for college?""
A: ""My apologies to you and Macho the stallion. I'll be getting a stipend, if that's not enough, luckily, I like instant noodles.""

B: ""That would be a good idea.  Have you had any luck yet? any prospects?""
A: ""Yeah there is so far two that are interested so i'm trying to look for something that we can all fit in. How is your new stallion, is he getting on with the other 3 horses you have? ""
B: ""Yes, although he can be a bit temperamental at times.  He really likes my wife though.  ""
A: ""Oh he probably just needs some more time. Stallions have a crazier temperament than females horses. But at least he has taken a liking to your wife. ""
B: ""Yes, whenever he sees the donkey following her he tries to chase it away. I think he's jealous!  Are you going to take your car to the city?  That can probably get expensive too, I imagine.""
A: ""Yeah that mostly is a case of jealously especially if your donkey is male also. And no im going to leave my car at my parents the city is too busy easier to catch the train everywhere. ""
B: ""That makes sense.  Keeps you from having to find a nearby parking garage and having to put up with that expense as well.  ""
A: ""Exactly i do not want to deal with that on top of everything else. I am hoping to also get something close to the school that way i don't ever really have to travel far. I will be too busy with school work for any leisure anyway. ""

B: ""Yes - you will need to clean out the bunny pens, feed them, and spend time petting the bunnies. It's quite easy, even I can manage it and I'm so clumsy! Does that sound okay?""
A: ""Yes it is perfect, also do I need to special clothing ? I imagine that place must be a little bit dirty.""
B: ""You don't need any special clothing. I just wear normal everyday clothes. Don't wear anything too nice because you'll probably get bunny droppings on them!""
A: ""That is what I thought. Do I need to bring my lunch or there are restaurants in the area ?""
B: ""I'd recommend bringing your own lunch or at least a few snacks. They don't provide food there unless you want to eat carrots! Have you ever worked in a pet shelter before?""
A: ""Never, I never had a pet also, it that a problem ?""
B: ""It shouldn't be a problem - they let me volunteer even though I've never had a bunny as a pet before. You don't need experience, you just need to love animals!""

A: ""That is a great idea! I wonder how much would you sell honey for at a local farmer's market? ""
B: ""Hm, I guess that depends on the quality! Maybe I should get the honey tested to make sure it's good quality. Have you ever thought about performing one of your songs at a farmer's market?""
A: ""I never even knew that was an option! You could also use the excess honey to cook with. You could experiment with papaya and honey and make face masks as well. I hear both are good for your skin.""
B: ""I could use a nice face mask after gorging on seafood. Had any good lobster lately?""
A: ""Yes, actually I have! I had lobster tail last week. It was delicious. The hardest part of making the papaya honey face mask for you would be not eating the papaya! Haha. I know how much you like it.""

B: ""I bet a ginger honey glaze would work well with grilled shrimp, with some veggies on the side. thanks for the idea!""
A: ""Now, I am hungry haha! No problem! Thank you for the idea to sing my songs at a local farmer's market. I am definitely going to look into that.""

B: ""I can understand. The first few steps are always the hardest. And you have already taken them. So it should get easier from here. I am sure your parents will come around and support you. When do you plan to show it to them?""
A: ""Once I finish arranging it. I'm not sure if I should play it for them on the piano or on the guitar. What do you think?""
B: ""Great idea. Since I am into music I would be willing to help you with the music part of it. Do let me know if you need help or need another ear to hear the final product.""
A: ""That would be a good idea!  I'm sort of stuck on a bridge for the song too. I'm not sure if maybe it should be an instrumental bridge or a bridge with lyrics.""

A: ""I would be scared to have a robot in my bedroom too. Does it smell funny?""

B: ""Awesome. I'm cooking some burgers on the grill. Cheeseburgers are my fave""
A: ""I love a good burger, but I try hard to stay thin and in shape.""
B: ""I am all about fitness. I used to be a gym teacher""
A: ""Did you have a special uniform? I love my skinny jeans and leggings.""
B: ""Just loose fitting clothing. That's about it""
A: ""I like band shirts, especially with ruffled sleeves.""
B: ""I was too poor to afford anything really growing up""
A: ""Is life better for you now?""
B: ""Yes. I serve food to the poor because of what I went through""
A: ""Truly that is a great way to give back. I admire you.""
B: ""Thank you so much. It is always great to volunteer for a cause.""
A: ""I saw a documentary on World War 2 and I am very sure you would like it. Have you seen it?""
B: ""Which documentary are you taking about? I have seen all kinds of them!""
A: ""World War 2 in Colour. It is a Netflix documentary. It shows a lot of historic footage that's been restored in color and shown in high definition!""
B: ""That sounds cool. I'll have to put it on the list. What have you been up to lately?""
A: ""I've been hunting for some fitness clothing deals online. Since the weather is getting warmer, I thought I would stock up on some clothes so that I can be out and about but be comfortable!""
B: ""I hear ya! I need to dig out some clothes. I stashed all the summer stuff away. Are you finding any good deals?""
A: ""Yeah, some! I specifically look for second hand clothing because I want to be environmentally conscious, and there are some good deals on clothing that people only wear once or twice and want to get rid of!""
B: ""This is true. Waste not want no I always say. I'm just glad the sun feels warm on my face again. Got any big fitness plans for the summer?""
A: ""I'm definitely planning on training for a marathon this summer. It's been in my bucket list for a while, and I want to start now.""
B: ""Nice. I may need to set some goals like that. It's been a while since I have felt motivated. A change in seasons helps though.""
A: ""Would you consider joining me on my marathon training? The regimen also can be tweaked for shorter distances!""
B: ""I would like to but I don't want to slow you down! How far do you run to train on avreage? ""
A: ""I have been reading about a programme that trains people for longer distance running. Sounds like something you might like?""
B: ""Possibly, but running isn't on my mind right now. I broke my ankle 4 days ago :(""
A: ""wow!  How did that happen?""
B: ""I caught my foot in a hole in the front yard and went down. So now I'm in a boot and have to take it easy for a month or so""

B: ""Yeah, at least I can work on my upper body still, that's no problem :) The running just has to wait a bit is all""

B: ""Oh wow that's a great idea! I think that would be awesome, I've never tried that before.""
A: ""How has your ankle been feeling? By the way, did you get a cheeseburger?""
B: ""My ankle is not great - it's going to be a while before I can walk again, let alone run. Believe me, I have been eating cheeseburgers all week! It's my comfort food!""
A: ""Well try not to get too out of shape whilst you are bed bound and eating cheeseburgers. ""
B: ""You're right, I really want to stay fit. It's just so hard to motivate myself, especially when I can't even exercise at the moment, so it feels almost pointless to eat healthy food!""
A: ""But you don’t have to eat unhealthy cheeseburgers. They have plant based burgers that taste even better than beef and are healthy too!""
B: ""Maybe I will try them - what sort would you recommend? Do you make your own burgers?""
A: ""No I don’t make them per se, they can be bought at the grocery store either in preformed patties or not. There are several brands but I prefer Light Life.""
B: ""If only I could walk to the grocery store, I would look for some. I'll try when my ankle has healed. Unless you want to bring me some?""
A: ""Well, I guess I could do that but first I want to figure out if you have any food allergies to soy or bioflavonoids or anything really. I don’t want to bring you an allergic reaction along with your lunch!""
B: ""Don't worry about that - I've never reacted to anything so I'm pretty sure I don't have any allergies!""
A: ""Ok well what would you like to have with the plant based burgers. Some type of salad or what?""
B: ""Salad would be amazing! But honestly, whatever you think! I know you are the expert on healthy eating. Thanks so much for doing this for me!""

A: ""Not really. It's so expensive trying to find dog sitters around where I am! I would like to go somewhere with nice, warm, sandy beaches... any recommendations?""
B: ""Definitely Florida, then. Next time I go I think you'd get a kick out of it! I love sitting on the beach and reading ""
A: ""Me too! I also like to make beach bonfires. Is that allowed on beaches in Florida?""

B: ""A glass of wine? That would be a great topper to the whole proceedings!""

B: ""My 3 cats are cheese crazy, they all seem to like cheddar for some reason! ""
A: ""Haha, perhaps cats and dogs have more in common than anyone previously thought, seems they're both fond of a bit of cheddar.""
B: ""I think so, everyone loves it. But I like eating havarti with my wine, or even Muenster :)""

B: ""Yes, our local cheese shop had it. It is so good! What kind of cheese do you like to drink with your wine?""

B: ""I like to walk in parks for good health. No soft drinks for me either!""
A: ""I love soft drinks when I study computer programming. I wish I could cut it off.""
B: ""I love sodas with my burgers and fries but I m trying to watch sugar intake""

B: ""Sodas in us made with high fructose corn syrup. Bad for you!""

A: ""Have you been lowering your sugar intake?""
B: ""Yeah! I bought a book called how to bake with less sugar, and it's given me lots of good ideas on how to use other sweeteners in my cooking as well.""
A: ""Is the flavor different when you use a different sweetener?""
B: ""I do have to admit, yes. But it's been great to use flavors that I don't mind, such as using honey in my tea or using fruits such as bananas in my smoothies. I end up using white sugar in my cooking because sometimes there's no great substitute, but I only use a small pinch.""
A: ""I tried switching to diet soft drinks but I didn't enjoy the taste. Maybe I'll try eating more fruits to satisfy my sweet tooth instead fo grabbing another soft drink.""
B: ""I think that's a great idea. Eating more fruits has definitely helped feel fuller too, so I've been able to watch my calories more easily too.""
A: ""It's always good to drop a few pounds so you can show off when the weather gets warm""
B: ""Yes. The elusive six pack may in the works as well. We will see!""
A: ""Keep me posted. Coaching swimming keeps me in shape.""
B: ""Does the pool that you use for coaching have public swimming hours? I would love to swim to help my fitness level!""

B: ""I see. Yeah I don't want to be swimming when it's crowded with families and teenagers! Yuck!""
A: ""I just came in from coaching swimming and the pool today was not crowded at all; I thought of you.""

B: ""Yeah, the cat's sitting right beside me as we speak. His name is Chester. Chester The Mouse Molester lol he likes to slap around the mice before he finishes them off""
A: ""That's a great name! Chester sounds like he would be very entertaining. Have you walked him on a leash?""
B: ""He's not terribly keen on that, we tried it a few times and you'd think he'd die. Jumping up in the air and all haha""
A: ""I would keep trying. I've always wanted to walk a cat on a leash. It turns heads.""
B: ""Yeah it's fun to do, but I don't think Chester is one who appreciates it a whole lot. He likes just laying around the house""
A: ""Ahh, to have a cat's life. Just laying around on a sunny spot. Then once in a while do some terrorizing. ""
B: ""Cats are pretty lucky, treated like gods lol just like my boyfriend""
A: ""Well, after our conversation, I went to my neighbor's house and offered to walk their cat on a leash. The cat was not very happy. It didn't go well.""
B: ""Oh no! I usually have so much fun with it. Maybe you can walk Chester some time!""
A: ""Yeah, i would give it a try! I think my leash was too short. My neighbor's cat tried to jump at a bird and almost strangled itself.""
B: ""Haha okay, that must have been it. I'm guessing it was a short walk?""
A: ""Yeah, and part drag! lol How come your boyfriend didn't take you with him on his photoshoot?  I bet Cozumel would have been romantic!""
B: ""I know I should have gone with him! I'm busy taking care of Chester, though, which has not been very glamorous. How has the swim coaching been going?""
A: ""Pretty good, for the most part. A few of my swimmers need leashes themselves.  They keep forgetting to see how close they are to the end of the pool and hitting their heads.""
B: ""Oh okay, yeah that's a rookie mistake! They probably don't pay you enough. Now, do you study programming before or after swim practice? Or during?""
A: ""Usually after. It helps me unwind. I'm afraid to do it during.  Somebody might drown!""
B: ""Yeah, that makes a lot of sense! I like to take walks in parks to unwind, personally.""
A: ""You should go with your boyfriend on his next photo shoot. I bet that would help you undwind! I could watch Chester for you. Maybe even teach him to swim.""

A: ""You definitely don't want a breed that could get aggressive or that requires a considerable amount of training.  I find that golden retrievers, labs, and boxers are excellent companions.  I guess the other thing to think about is the size of the dog...would you want a smaller or more medium/large breed?""
B: ""I would want one to keep in the house so it doesn't need to shed much.  I like the idea of a smaller dog but somewhat manly?  Andy idea of dogs based on that?""
A: ""Hmm.  The smaller you go, the less ""manly"" the dog becomes, I think lol.  Daschunds are cute...so are beagles...but beagles tend to howl.""
B: ""I wouldn't mind a beagle I guess.  Have you ever owned one?  ""
A: ""I personally have not, but my grandmother did.  She let the poor thing get drastically overweight.  The beagle did howl quite a bit, which was a bit much to deal with at times...but she also didn't train him to not howl as much, so maybe that could be something you work on with the dog.""
B: ""Well, I also live in a rural area, so the howling might not be as big of a deal.  I know you work.  I do too.  What do you do with your dogs while you are working?""
A: ""I crate-trained the dogs early on, so when it is time for me to go to work, they head into their crate (it's quite large) and they stay in there until I get home.  Lucky for me, I work close to home, so I usually stop home for lunch, let the dogs out a bit to play and stretch, and then they go back in the crates until I'm done with work for the day.  Some people I know send their dogs to a doggie daycare.""
B: ""Well, my job is boring.   But my boss might not care if I bring my dog to work with me.  He has a bird.  I would just have to work on the howling.  Did you train your dogs yourself or did you send them to obedience training?""
A: ""You never told me what you do for work?  You mentioned it was boring... have you ever thought about doing something else?  ""

A: ""I def. have felt that way before. It does get better. It just takes time. If you feel like this is a really big rut, maybe reach out and get some help and start transitioning to get a new job. Have you loooked at any job openings in your area?""
B: ""It's more than the endless toil of work. It is my wife. Well I should really get used to saying ex-wife, because that is what she is. It is hard to accept. Maybe I will start a Smiths cover band to get my feelings out.""

B: ""Thank you, that's really kind of you. I think a dog would really help me. What breed are your dogs? I'm thinking of getting a small one.""
A: ""Maybe a dog won’t help your depression after all. I mean if you are really depressed having a dog might make you feel worse.""
B: ""I'm honestly ready to try anything. A dog would give me a responsibility and get me out of the house for walks. I won't know until I try - but I like the idea of spending time with your dogs first to see how I get on.""
A: ""I am a little concerned for their safety living with a depressed person what If you forget to feed them or let them outside to use the bathroom?""
B: ""You have a point, but I don't think I would forget to feed them or let them out. I think they would give me a reason to get moving. What kind of dog would you recommend for me? ""
A: ""Hmmmm… it really all depends. I guess I would say a mutt. A rescue animal that no one else would think twice about adopting. That way you know that only you are capable of being the mutt’s owner. ""
B: ""That's a good way of looking at it. I'm worried about adopting a rescue animal though - is there a chance they could be aggressive?""
A: ""Yes, but there’s also a chance they could kick field goals in the NFL like that one Disney movie. Life is about chances if the dog bites you when you pet it the first time, It’s too aggressive.""
B: ""Haha, I like the attitude. I guess if my dog did turn out to be aggressive, I could get you to help me train it? ""

B: ""Is it a high ride? You already know I am afraid of heights.""
A: ""No, it is in the dark and not a high ride. Splash Mountain is higher for sure. What is favorite thing to eat while you are at Disney?""
B: ""Corn dogs are my favorite. They are hard to get where I live so I am going to eat a ton of them when I am there. Do you have a favorite Disney snack?""
A: ""The corndogs are great! I love the churros. I will eat a few a day when I am there. ""
B: ""I forgot about churros. Now I don't know what to eat! I didn't realize Splash Mountain was high. Now I don't know what rides to go on. Maybe if I close my eyes! ""
A: ""You could have a corndog first and churro for dessert! I suggest that you go on the rides regardless if they are high or not. Trust me, they will all be worth it. ""
B: ""That's a great idea! Does your sister have a favorite ride?""

A: ""Yum! I love corn dogs!  Hey! We should go to Disneyland together!  You are a lot nicer than my sister. Maybe you'd rub off on her!  She'd like you because she likes to sing and dance all the time.  ""
B: ""Awesome! I would love to come with you guys. But i should warn you i will be Anna in the frozen world.""
A: ""She'll probably try to insist there are two Anna's.  She's pretty stubborn.  And don't tell her I said so, but when she dances she sort looks like an old crow flapping it's wings.  Sings like one too!""

B: ""Not yet. I feel a bit nervous. Do you think I should go for it? How can I motivate myself?""
A: ""You should go for it! There's a good book you could read, called Calling in The One. And you could also try looking up how to write a dating profile that stands out on google. Have you used any of the apps before?""
B: ""No. Do you have any suggestion as to which one I should start with? I don't want girls to think I'm just looking for casual sex, if you know what I mean..""

A: ""Hey, how are you? I was just daydreaming about my favorite car.""
B: ""I'm good. Just came back from mountain biking.""
A: ""I rode a bike to work today, speaking of which want to buy a watch?""
B: ""Not really. I'd buy a cup of coffee though.""
A: ""I should have been a barista... My dad makes fun of my career choice all the time.""
B: ""Do you sell watches?""
A: ""I do. But I spend all my paychecks on more watches. And shoes.""
B: ""Interesting job. Do you drink?""
A: ""I subside entirely on royal crown cola.""
B: ""That is funny. My favorite drink is a cup of coffee""
A: ""If I collect enough empty cans I can sell them for a rolls royce.""
B: ""That would be a lot of cans.""
A: ""It isn't like I have it any other way, I'm paid entirely in broken watches.""
B: ""I don't understand that. How are you paid in broken watches?""
A: ""Have you been mountain biking anywhere interesting lately?""
B: ""Yes, actually. I went to a nearby trail and spent a few hours biking! It was so much fun! What is your favorite pair of shoe you own?""
A: ""I have two brands of shoes that I tend to prefer. Jack Wolfskin and Oboz for their trail running shoes. They're a cross between a hiking boot and a running shoe. Super comfortable, waterproof, and durable.""
B: ""Wow, interesting. I'll definitely have to check those out! Have you thought about getting a car so you don't have to bike to work or do you enjoy riding?""
A: ""I have thought about it but I'm not sure it would pay off with savings in the end. I like vintage cars a lot. Do you mean vintage or modern cars? ""
B: ""I didn't have a specific type in mind. Wow, I really enjoy vintage cars too...preferably Chevy Trucks, like the 51' Apache or the 71' Chevy C10 Sidestep! Those are beautiful pieces of American made trucks!""
A: ""I want a classic Ford, myself. I tend to be a Ford person, not a Chevy one. Either a '57-67 old truck, or a '67 Ford Mustang GT. I prefer cars that I can fix, today's are too computerized. I'm not sure buying one would pay off with work 2 blocks away. ""
B: ""You're so right about that, they make things to wear out faster and price things to high these days. I can see why now riding your bike is much more efficient! How convenient to be that close to you job! Guess what I did today? I went and tried out one of Starbucks Cinnamon Roll Frappuccino...it was fantastic! But I think their White Iced Mocha Frappuccino is my favorite! ""
A: ""That sounds fantastic! I love Starbucks but don't get it very often because it can be expensive. I love their Frappuccino's the most. I'll have to try the Cinnamon Roll one! I wonder if they have it at the shop near my home. Do you have other things you like there? ""
B: ""Oh yes, I love just about everything including their food selections. They have fantastic breakfast, they have a bacon gouda and egg sandwich that is just melts in your mouth! I tend to go to Starbucks to treat myself once every couple weeks. You're right it can be expensive. I am a nifty shopper and try to find coupons or discounts online before going. I meant to ask you, what kind of watches do you sell?""
A: ""I usually buy gift cards when they're having bonus ones during the holiday season. Sometimes you can get $240 worth of gift cards there for $200 and such. I'm not as huge of a fan of their food, but I love trying all their drinks. I think the Refreshers are my favorite thing, along with the Cold Brew and the Frappuccinos. The new Kiwifruit/Starfruit Refresher is my new favorite. The Mango/Dragonfruit is a second.  ""
B: ""I have seen the Mango/Dragonfruit but I haven't tried it. I have however, had the Kiwifruit/Starfruit Refresher it was pretty delicious! When Summertime comes I'll be interested in trying out the different refreshers.  I get in on those deals too, with the gift cards! I love free money!  I like gifting to friends and family too, they get excited when I share my good fortunes with them!""
A: ""I have a buddy that has a classic Ford for sale; it looks like a good deal; I might buy it""
B: ""It sounds exactly like what you were looking for! Will you need to do a lot of work to fix it up?""
A: ""Yeah it needs a bit, but thats the fun of it.""
B: ""Will you drive that to work instead of riding your bike?""
A: ""With the way people drive around here, probably not. It will be my fun ride. Plus the more i save riding my bike, the more i can put into the car!""
B: ""That's a smart idea! I bet you could negotiate with them to buy the car for a lower price since it will need some repairs. I always try to haggle on prices!""
A: ""Yeah, wont have to haggle to much, he is a buddy, pretty much giving it to me at cost. Hey have you had the chance yet to try the kiwifruit refresher?""
B: ""I went yesterday to try it, and you were right that it is delicious! Do you have any other drink recommendations I can try?""
A: ""No, ive just been gettin that after a long bike ride. It really is great!""
B: ""Where do you like to go when you ride your bike? Do you go on paved roads or more remote trails?""
A: ""Mostly its just paved when i have to run errands, when i do have free time i love to ride the trails at the park.""
B: ""That sounds fun! I mostly ride my mountain bike on hiking trails. I like to check out difficult trails deep in the wilderness.""
A: ""Do you go mountain biking on your own or do you go in a group?""
B: ""I usually go alone, but I've done it with a group before too.  There's pros and cons to both.  How about you? Do you typically ride the trails along?""
A: ""It depends on the day, I have a few friends that like to ride so they go with me quite a bit. I am also part of a cycling club and we all ride together once a week.""
B: ""Yeah that sounds a lot like me.  I like being part of a community, but there's also something very freeing about being out in the wilderness all alone.""
A: ""Do you wear any type of device that allows people to track your location for safety? I'd be scared being too far out in the wilderness all alone""
B: ""I'll typically have my cell phone with me, but otherwise I don't do anything special.  You'd be surprised how well your body will keep track of things like your heading and the distance you've traveled once you've practiced a little bit.""
A: ""I will take your word for it! Have you tried any new drinks at Starbucks lately?""
B: ""Yeah I tried the Iced Pineapple Matcha last week and it was amazing!  Still haven't gotten to try the Kiwi Starfruit Refresher, but maybe next time!  Have you ever tried the pineapple macha?""
A: ""I haven't, it sounds really interesting. I will add it to my list of drinks to try! The Kiwi Starfruit Refresher is still my favorite, you won't be disappointed.""
B: ""I'll be sure to try it soon!  It's been so hot out lately that it sounds delicious right now actually.  Have you still been biking to work?""
A: ""Yes, I have to take advantage of the nicer weather since I can't ride my bike to work in the winter. It helps me to feel like I've accomplished something first thing in the morning.""

I like that people are so complicated from their wide range of interests and simple in how they feel about their interests. I'm addicted to people. So, yes, I am definitely seeing multiple people still. Thank you for asking.""
A: ""Do you have any business partners in your dog-walking / fertilizer selling businesses?""
B: ""My business partners are the dogs that I walk. I contribute a part of my income from that business to the parents of those dogs. This way they can afford food, healthcare and the occasional toy because they are so nice and good.""
A: ""That's an interesting strategy. I didn't even know most people knew who the parents of their dogs are.""
B: ""The parents are the humans who take care of them. I'm sorry for not clarifying this for you earlier. I love these dogs. They are so smart. ""
A: ""Oh, OK. I though you meant literal biological parents. Have you ever gone for a walk with them and forgotten or run out of waste bags?""
B: ""Sometime I do forget, but in moments like that, I just move the fertilizer toward the grass area. This way the fertilizer can help nearby plants.""
A: ""I was inspired by your dog-waking job and put some flyers up in my neighborhood to start my own business.""
B: ""You will be great at it, especially since you enjoy walking! Start a social media page too to get the word out.""
A: ""Good idea! Maybe I can expand to taking care of people's horses one day, too. That would be amazing!""
B: ""For sure! I bet that would pay even better than dog walking too.""

B: ""What kind of business is it? Have you developed a business plan yet?""
A: ""its a animal grooming business for dogs mainly, maybe you could recommend it to your owners of the dogs you walk?""
B: ""Sure, but you need to plan it out carefully *before* you start it. Too many businesses fail because the folks who start them run into unanticipated complications. You can't anticipate everything, but you'd be surprised how much you can....""

A: ""Be as detailed as you can be about your interest(s) in the field. They want dedicated people, because the work is difficult and stressful on the body and mind.""
B: ""Okay, I can certainly make sure that I'm detailed.  Thinking about my app, I'm worried about seeming wishy-washy and wish I'd been on a more consistent path since I was younger.""
A: ""Your personal history is important, but not as important as you might think in EMT work. What are you concerned about?""
B: ""I feel like my work experience doesn't really show much interest in the medical field.  Like, I've really loved being in the orchestra but I feel like it doesn't help me break into the medical field at all.""
A: ""Ah, no, that's not an issue. They want live, dedicated individuals...""
B: ""Okay, thank you, I know you're the expert here so I will stop worrying so much!  I'll just stay optimistic and try to present myself with enthusiasm.""
A: ""The good folks who hire EMTs want people who are deeply interested in the work and who will be trainable and sustainable. You'll know pretty quickly whether or not you're cut out for the work. So don't worry about it. Apply and follow through. That's my professional advice.""
B: ""Sounds good, maybe if you get this job at the clinic I'll be able to find work their too.  It would be awesome to know someone at work before as I'm getting started.""
A: ""Probably not. You're going to be busier than you've ever been before as an EMT. And I suspect you'll love the work. If you have any doubts going forward, confide in me, and I'll give you my best advice...""
B: ""Sage advice for sure.  What's next for you if you don't get the clinic job? Still considering your own practice?""

B: ""They are very good and enjoying the warm weather, I like to read history as well but never visited Europe, what part of USA do you live?""
A: ""I live in the west coast with near to pacific ocean, you should start thinking of travelling more to explore the world like Columbus.""

A: ""I would say to visit the Italy and Rome as it has a lot of history associated to it and you will enjoy.""
B: ""That is amazing as I always liked the Roman Empire and imagined how the structures are built.""
A: ""I booked a cruise in the next few months. ""
B: ""Where are you planning on going? I'd love to go to Europe!""
A: ""Well actually, I booked a European cruise. It is going to be so amazing. We are traveling through the Mediterranean Ocean and making several port stops. ""
B: ""That sounds wonderful. I think you will get your fill of fish while your traveling.""
A: ""I really hope so, I have heard they have some of the best fish in the world. Hey so, how are your horses doing?""
B: ""They are all pretty happy. They are out grazing in the field right now. They get pretty frisky this time of day and need space to gallop around.""
A: ""That makes sense but, letting them out to pasture is truly the best thing for them. Do plan on taking them riding anytime soon?""
B: ""I like to go near dusk and watch the sun set with my favorite horse. He looks for me every day when it's near that time like clock work.""

A: ""Does it have ever been in a real race ?""
B: ""Yes, a while ago! He didn't win unfortunately but came a good third""
A: ""How do you train a horse to race ?""
B: ""Well it needs to be the right kind of breed to start with, like from a line of race horses. And then you do lots of training with it to keep it fit and healthy and teach it to run!""
A: ""So training a horse is a full time job, did you train it yourself ?""
B: ""It can be if you want to be really good at it! I did but my family helped a lot too, my parents have always done it.""
A: ""Do you like to train horse for racing ? I don't think I could do it, I would not want to hurt my horses. ""
B: ""I do but I don't think I would like it if I was trying to be the very best at it - I think the horses enjoy a bit of more casual racing but it can get a bit brutal when lots of money is involved.""
A: ""That is the thing that is bothering me horse racing, it is very artificial. Humans never needed horse races for their survival. And it can be dangerous for the horses.  ""

A: ""I was telling the kids at the shelter about your pony and they wanted to ask if you could send a photo I could show them. ""
B: ""Of course. I've got tons of photos with the kids at the children's hospital riding on him. I wonder if the homeless shelter would let me bring the pony over one day.""

B: ""They loved him. They laughed and giggled. Smiles all around... except for one shy little boy who wouldn't come close""
A: ""That's awesome, and yes, I would love to see a photo!""
B: ""I'll send over a few good ones once I'm back at my computer. How old are most of the kids at the shelter where you volunteer?""

B: ""I try to cheer up the kids, but I don't think I make any lasting impressions. Your work seems much more fulfilling.""

A: ""Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. Please let me know if there's anything I can do. Do you know what happened?""
B: ""The necropsy showed that Jericho ate some toxic stuff. Can you distract me by regaling some funny stories from your volunteering?""
A: ""I wish. It's been nothing but depressing stories at the shelter lately. I still love what I do, but times are really hard for everyone. Again, I'm so sorry about Jericho.""
B: ""I'm sure he's enjoying his big open pasture in the sky. I'm sorry the shelter has been just depressing lately. Can I ask why you decided to volunteer with the homeless?""
A: ""My father was actually homeless for a short amount of time, and it really stuck with me when he told me all about it. Just how ignored and invisible he felt, and so I wanted to make sure no one else felt that way.""
B: ""Oh wow, what a personal connection. It must be tough and emotional. You are doing good work. How long have you been volunteering?""
A: ""A few years now. It's definitely been a rollercoaster of emotions but I'd recommend it to anyone! Have you been to the kid's hospital lately?""
B: ""I'm actually going later today. Those kids love ponies. It'll be a good distraction for me. ""
A: ""That's a good idea. Jericho will be watching down happily wherever he is. Did you ever take him with you?""
B: ""No, I didn't take him to the hospital just the mini pony, Tina. I'm happy I won't have that association. Jericho actually hated kids. Have you been horseback riding?""
A: ""I was talking to a friend an hour ago regarding their volunteer experience at a charity they help out for at times, and they told me the funniest thing that ever happened to them at a volunteer event. I think it would help cheer you up, I would be glad to tell you it if you are interested.""
B: ""Please do tell me! This week has been very rough for me.""
A: ""Right, so they were talking to one of the people there, thinking that it was another volunteer. And they managed to spill their drink all over them! Embarrassing, but it turned out that it was actually the chief donor! ""
B: ""Haha, it is funny to see that even the rich and well-connected are capable of embarrassing themselves.  Sometimes when I think about being a lawyer I have this picture of the other lawyers as inhuman, but really they are probably just normal people with a higher paying job.""
A: ""Yes exactly! I think he might have donated a bit more to make up for it though so it was all good. That's definitely true, everyone is human""
B: ""That would have been very nice of him if he did!  That was a wonderful story, and it does cheer me up a bit.  Anything else that's interesting happen to you lately?""
A: ""Ah good! Not so much to be honest, i've just been working really. How about you?""
B: ""I've just been keeping busy with the horses while trying to keep my mind off of the one that recently passed.  Now that it's springtime they're starting to be much more active, which is a nice distraction for me.""
A: ""That's great! How are they doing? Do you get to ride them much?""
B: ""Yeah, I'm lucky to be able to ride them all the time!  The little ones are doing great too, it's so exciting seeing how quickly some of them grow up.  You can come by and visit them anytime if you'd like!""
A: ""I'm glad to hear it! Where are you located?""

A: ""I just got an invitation to sponsor for a charity run""
B: ""That is amazing. I know you were planning on doing something with animals. Did you decide what you are going to do?""
A: ""I would like to organize a fundraiser for rescuing retired race horses. a lot of times once they are past their prime they are put down. I hate to see that happen to them.""
B: ""That makes so much sense. The therapeutic horse farm that my parents work at did a fun run but did it along the horse enclosure so that when the people ran by the horses would run along with the people. It was so cool!""
A: ""That must have been wonderful to grow up around. I love riding horses competitively but I hate the darker side of it. Do you have any tips for raising money? You did so well with your fundraiser.""
B: ""Yeah, that was mostly my parents doing. I wish I could ask them for some tips. I really miss them since they passed away and it has been much harder for me to raise large amount of money.""
A: ""Understandable, How old were you when they passed away?""
B: ""I was in my early twenties so, at least I was able to learn a lot from them. The best thing you can do for your fundraiser is try to do something original but, coming up with the idea is always the most difficult idea. ""
A: ""I am sorry for your loss! Maybe I could bring my horse to the fundraiser, if that is allowed. That should draw some attention!""
B: ""Yeah, that sounds like a great idea! You could even ride the horse around at the fundraiser!""
A: ""Fingers crossed that they would let me do that. If they do, my cousin harper can come ride with me too.""
B: ""That would be amazing both of you on horses would get a lot of attention!""
A: ""Is booking a DJ a good idea for the fundraiser in your experience?""
B: ""Yeah I think its worth the cost. You might be able to find someone to do it for free if they care about the cause too. Music is important to get everyone in a good mood and for people to enjoy themselves. Just putting on the radio or a playlist won't be nearly as good ""
A: ""Ok thanks! Do you have any you would recommend me talking to?""
B: ""There is a guy named Dan who did the last few runs I was on. He was really good, kept the crowd entertained, and seemed to play the perfect music for the situation. I don't know his last name or phone number but I can get it for you from someone else who was at the run. I can help you get sponsorship as well. Get any sponsors for the run yet?""
A: ""Nice! Yes we've had a couple of good ones so far thanks, $1000!""
B: ""Maybe I can bring my dog Harper over when I'm done with work tomorrow and we can go over some ideas. I know how much you love horses and I think you have a great idea to help raise money for them.""
A: ""That sounds great! How is Harper?""
B: ""Harper's been doing great. He's just getting out of his puppy phase. I bring him to the hospital whenever I go and the kids love him, and he loves the attention. ""
A: ""That's wonderful, I suppose they don't get to see many animals being stuck in the hospital?""
B: ""They have a few therapy pets come by each month, but they all seem to like Harper the best. ""
A: ""Must be very satisfying for you! Schnauzers are beautiful dogs""
B: ""I'd bring him to your charity race but I think he might spook the horses, or the horses would spook him. ""

A: ""Lets  go  to  theater to  watch a drama . ""
B: ""Sure. Which drama did you have in mind?""
A: ""Do you want something contemporary, or historic (like Ibsen?) I hear there's a modern remake of ""Of Mice and Men"".""
B: ""No thanks. The movie Soul just came out last year. It's a movie made by Disney and Pixar. That movie is a nice drama around the life a music teacher. He likes playing his piano. I think we might both enjoy this.""
A: ""Is that the one where he dies and goes to a limbo-y, heaven-y type place? It seems a bit lighthearted for a drama.""
B: ""The drama part around this movie lies in the freedom of expression and the valuing of another individuals existence. The music teacher connecting with someone else and the ghost child's journey of self awareness.""
A: ""That does sound a bit dramatic. A bit existential for Pixar, no? All right, I'll go. Maybe we can grab some Mexican beforehad.""
B: ""Let's get rolled tacos and bring them into the theater while they are still warm. Theater food is expensive.""
A: ""I agree that theater food is expensive, but there's no reason not to eat in a restaurant ahead of time.  Plus I'd like, maybe, to eat something harder to bring in the theater, like carnitas.""
B: ""Carnitas are a legit vibe. Let's get extra guacamole with horchata because carbs aren't even a real thing.""
A: ""You certainly don't mean Gucamole WITH horchta...that would be disgusting ... surely you mean, ""guacamole and also get some horchata""  PS I don't like horchata. Too rice-y. But YASS to the extra guacamole!!!""
B: ""That's exactly what I mean. We vibe so well together. ""
A: ""So you teach 5 days a week?""
B: ""I like to think that I teach my entire life. I can teach at the grocery store or in a classroom.""
A: ""But do you get paid for teaching at the grocery store?""
B: ""no, i just get paid teaching in a classroom.""

A: ""I'll have to check it out. Any other music recommendations?""
B: ""Please check out my soundcloud. I make music just like this.""
A: ""Remember the music producer friend I was telling you about, she just offered me 2 passes to a Radiohead concert in our city. I immediately though of you. Interested?""
B: ""Omg yes that would be perfect, it sounds like a lot of fun. Let me know how much to give you for the ticket. And just messages me the details. ""
A: ""Sweet, I'll text you the details later when I get them.  I won't be paying anything for the tickets though, so don't worry about paying me anything for it.  If you want to split parking that would be great though!  Have you ever been to a Radiohead concert?""
B: ""Oh okay that’s great and yes I will definitely help pay for parking. I haven’t been able to see them live yet this is super exciting. ""
A: ""Sounds good, I'm going to really have to start listening to some Radiohead to learn their songs before we go.  Concerts are way more fun when you know the songs.  Maybe I'll start with Creep first?  Any other songs that are must-listens?""
B: ""Yeah me too need to makes sure I have all the lyrics down. Yes start with Creep first and then do the song No surprises that’s another great song. ""
A: ""Okay I'll make sure to check out No Surprises too! I'm pretty excited about this!  Do you have anything else going on this week?""

B: ""That would be awesome! Now the weather's getting better I'm itching to get outside!""
A: ""Agreed! This winter was so long, thankfully its starting to get warm and beautiful outside. I've always wanted to go to the grand canyon but I have never had the chance""
B: ""Me too. It's really been a lifelong dream of mine to go. I need to buy a new pair of hiking shoes first though - my old ones are falling apart.""
A: ""The right pair of shoes makes a world of difference. I used to hike in normal sneakers and by the end of the hike my feet were killing me!""
B: ""Oh god, I can imagine. I need as much ankle support as possible or I slip all over the place and one of these days I'll break them both. The joys of getting older!""
A: ""You and me both. Maybe if we are tired from the hike we can do the donkey rides to bring us back up the canyon!""
B: ""You're full of good ideas today! That sounds awesome. In actual fact let's plan on that, then I know we have something relax to look forward to at the end!""
A: ""I'm glad we are on the same page. I like to hike, but lets be real, i work inside all day. I'm not a mountain climber""
B: ""For sure, and I'm not exactly known for my physical prowess either, ha. Aim for a good view, not a good workout, right?""
A: ""Those are words to live by in my opinion. This sounds like it will be a really fun trip. I cant wait.""
B: ""Me too. We should see if we pass any Corvette and BMW dealerships on the journey there, might as well treat ourselves to a look at some nice wheels!""
A: ""I just checked the weather and found out it is supposed to rain this weekend! I guess my plan to hike a local trail is ruined now. ""
B: ""What do you think you'll do instead?""
A: ""Not sure...maybe I will get some work done around the house. Do you have any upcoming hikes planned aside from the Grand Canyon?""

A: ""Have you gotten your new hiking boots yet?""
B: ""No I haven't just been looking through some shops for possible replacement boots. Just get sucked in to reading reviews. Back when I would buy shoes in store things would be much faster!""

A: ""That is what I'm hoping.  I just hope my parents get over being upset with me.  I'm here because my friend took us for a drive in his step mothers car without asking.  She reported it stolen and I hope they understand it wasn't my fault. But, I'm dreaming of pizza.  lol""

A: ""That's sounds great.  My mouth is watering.  Do you feed your dogs pizza while you eat?""

A: ""That's nice of the restaurant.  Is The Big Slice of Cheese a chain restaurant or just a single location?""
B: ""I've never seen another one around, so I think it is just a single location.  How is your time in juvi going?""

A: ""This will be my first time seeing the Stones in person, actually.  Take a guess which song is my favorite.""
B: ""I wonder if it's ""Gimme Shelter""? You know that's my favourite.""
A: ""Holy moly, you got it!  That's an amazing song.  I also like ""Sympathy for the Devil"" and ""Paint it Black,"" among others.  But ""Gimme Shelter"" is the Stone's best, I think.""
B: ""My favourite Springsteen song is ""Dancing in the Dark"". How about you?""
A: ""You know, I've been listening to a lot of the Boss recently, too.  With the Stones I originally loved ""Angie"" and then after you told me about ""Gimme Shelter"" I went back and listened to more of their stuff and my preference changed to ""Gimme Shelter.""  But with the Boss it's always the same for me: ""I'm on Fire.""  But honestly there's barely a bad Springsteen song, and ""Dancing in the Dark"" is great.""
B: ""By coincidence, I didn't used to like Springsteen, but he's grown on me since you mentioned you had seen him live and how good he was. ""
A: ""He's a poet, I think.  One of the great American storytellers.  I'm glad you've come to appreciate him more!""
B: ""Maybe he will win the Nobel Prize for literature one day, like Bob Dylan!""
A: ""Yes, I really think he could.  Do you like Dylan?  I really like Bob Dylan, too.  I suppose one could dislike his voice, but not his music or lyrics.""

A: ""Hi there, did you know I am super high maintenance?""
B: ""Well considering I do not know you? No, but I am too""
A: ""Well yeah, I love to go around spending money everywhere""
B: ""I spend the most money, on hair care products honestly, my favorite""
A: ""I don not really spend it on hair, I spend it on tanning beds""
B: ""I really want to try that once, I heard its bad for you""
A: ""Yeah I listen to brittney spears while tanning.""
B: ""Go figure. What do you do for fun""
A: ""Spend cash, go shopping, drink smoothies""
B: ""Ha, wow, sounds pretty irresponsible.""
A: ""No it is totally cool, haters going to hate""
B: ""Not really, I am all for it. After you do what your supposed to""
A: ""Yeah you bet, what do you like to do for fun?""
B: ""I play a lot of video games, especially the xbox""
A: ""Wow, you must be super popular like my boyfriend""
B: ""Video games do not make any one popular, more the opposite""
A: ""Tanning beds actually aren't bad for you if you don't overuse them. If you use them a moderate amount, you can actually protect yourself from being burned by the sun.""
B: ""Do you know a specific brand or a specific salon that is guaranteed super safe and effective? I would like to try it. Ohh and a smoothie sounds good after all those pampering!""
A: ""The one on 5th avenue is great ! There is also a smoothie bar nearby. What is your favorite flavor ?""
B: ""I love strawberry and banana! Have you been to a Britney Spears concert?? I don't really like crowds, I would rather stay in and play xbox! But I think experiencing a concert is gonna be awesome!""
A: ""Britney will come here in 4 months, I already bought my ticket, you should too if you want to go, they will be sold out soon. ""
B: ""Maybe its hard not to go if I'm with somebody. Do you mind if I tag along with you?""
A: ""No, I would like you to come with me. It will be fun. We could have matching hairstyles, do you have any idea ?""
B: ""Sure! That's great. Do you have a boyfriend? We can double date! For the hairstyle we can go for the classic 90s look updo! ""
A: ""No I don't have a boyfriend, I broke up with him, he did not like to spend money. ""
B: ""Ahh thats ok! We can go by ourselves! Enjoy the evening with our matching hairstyles! I'm excited!""
A: ""Yeah, but you should buy a ticket a soon as possible. Do you have enough money ? The tickets  are quite expensive.""
B: ""Yeah I have enough money! I work a lot because I spend a lot. What kind of tickets did you get so I can buy the same""
A: ""Have you found tickets to the concert?""
B: ""No, not yet. I am having trouble finding free time since I work so much. When's the Britney Spears concert?""
A: ""I know you work so much! Its not for another 3 months so hopefully you can find the time.""
B: ""I'm sure I'll be able to take off work with 3 months notice. Maybe I'll try a tanning bed before the concert so I can look extra good""
A: ""Well if you need help picking out a good place or what to try, you know im somewhat of an expert haha""
B: ""Yes absolutely! How much does a session usually cost? And will I need more than one session to get the desired effect?""
A: ""Usually you want your first time to be your base. The place i go to regulary is like 30 bucks""
B: ""Oh that's not too bad! Especially since I spend a lot of money as it is- just a small expense. Cool! Maybe we could go together before the concert!""
A: ""I would love that! It would be great for you to have some time to relax!""
B: ""Awesome! I look forward to it! And I know, I worked 60 hours last week. I love video games but only get to play like once a week.""
A: ""Have you gotten to play anything good recently when you have time?""
B: ""I just got the newest Mortal Kombat game. I'm pretty sure they're making a movie based on the game. Weird, but I will definitely be seeing it!""
A: ""Are you doing your own hair for Brittney's concert? Or will you be pampering yourself at a salon?""
B: ""Oh, I am definitely doing it myself...I'm not trusting anyone else to do my hair when I'm going to be in front of my goddess! ""
A: ""I totally agree! I know you do a great job with your hair. You always look so great, you should tell me some of your secrets. ""
B: ""You know I've been thinking, work has it that Britney is going to begin another residency in Las Vegas. We should so meet up there! (I'll do your hair, lol)""
A: ""That would be so much fun. I would love to go to VEGAS! We could go on the strip, go to the clubs. Lets plan this. Are you going to be able to get off of work, it seems like your always there. ""
B: ""Seriously?!? Screw the job, I'll quit in a heartbeat for Britney!!! She definitely wasn't talking to me when she said ""Work B*$^#""!""
A: ""Maybe we could run into her if she is doing an extended stay in Vegas. I can get on twitter and try to find out where she hangs out when she's in town. Hopefully the rumor about Vegas is true. ""
B: ""When in Vegas, she lives at the villas at the Rio. So, she's right next to like the pool area, OMG...,.I would just freak if I saw her at the pool!""
A: ""So would I. I better start tanning so I look good when I see her. Maybe she will let us go backstage!""
B: ""I want her to take me home with her! (one can dream, right...) Have you ever been to Las Vegas? I used to live there.""
A: ""No I haven't. I heard so much about it. You can show me around everywhere I need to know. I watched the Real World Las Vegas once but thats about it. ""

B: ""Hi. Good. I am just picking out paint for my new apartment with my boyfriend.""
A: ""Sounds like a good way to end the weekend""
B: ""Yeah. He won't go for red even though I love it. What is your favorite color?""
A: ""I like green but red would be nice also""
B: ""Green is okay. Silver is my other favorite.""
A: ""Are you a cat or dog person?""

B: ""Thanks so much for the invite!  We will be there!  How many people will be attending?""
A: ""I'm thinking it'll be around 20 people.  It really depends on who shows up since we are inviting a few more than that who probably won't come.  It's gonna be a blast!""
B: ""The weather will be great too!  Oh this will be fun!  Hey, how are your dog and cat doing?  I haven't asked about them in a while.""
A: ""They've been doing very well!  I just got a new leash for my dog that's longer and more flexible and he loves it when we go on walks!  How has your new apartment been?""
B: ""I love my new apartment!  It gets such great natural light which is fabulous.  However, I am not the best when it comes to decorating, so I'm having a bit of a hard time making the space my own...if that makes sense.  ""
A: ""Yeah, that makes perfect sense to me.  I think that's a common thing with new places.  They look clean and sharp, but also a bit sterile.  It will take some time to make it feel more like a home.""
B: ""I guess it just gives me more of an excuse to shop!  Haha!  How long have you lived in your place?""
A: ""Haha, that's true! We've been here for 5 years now and it's just starting to feel like a home.  I think having pets helps, have you thought about getting a dog or a cat?""
B: ""I actually have been considering getting a cat!  I've always loved cats, and since they can be somewhat independent, I think they would be great for apartment living.  Did you get your cat from a shelter or from a pet store?""
A: ""Okay, I have news.  The guy at work that is really lovely is single and is going to the party.  So, we have an objective, getting him to talk with me.""
B: ""That's awesome! Have you talked to him before? Or only seen him in passing?""
A: ""I've talked to him at work, but only casually. I'm hoping that we can talk more in depth at the party. ""
B: ""Are you both in the same department at work?""
A: ""Thankfully not. Being in the same department would make things messy. I don't actually get to see him that much.""
B: ""I can see that, too much time together at work might spoil the time you get together outside of work. Do you know if you guys already have some common ground? Other than work of course.""
A: ""I have no idea, haha. That's what I'm hoping to find out at the party. From what I know, though, he is very open minded and very kind to the people around him.""
B: ""Well that's definitely a good start! Maybe talk about your pets to see if he is an animal lover?""
A: ""Ooh that's a great idea. Loving animals is a definite must for me.""
B: ""Since we'll be on the rooftop, you can always talk about the view too. ""
A: ""Haha true, that could be a good opener, maybe. How did you and your husband meet?""
B: ""Oh we're not married yet, but I think that moving in together recently is taking us one step closer to that milestone. We actually met on an online dating website. Being able to view his profile really sped up the ""getting to know you"" phase.""
A: ""So, turns out that the guy from work is allergic dogs, cats, and birds. Do you think it's still worth it to chase after him? ""
B: ""no way! you would never be able to live together ""
A: ""Yeah, good point. Maybe I should find someone else. Do you and your boyfriend keep any pets?""
B: ""yes we have 2 cats, they're like my children""
A: ""Ah, okay. So let me ask you--if your SO was allergic to your cats, and couldn't stand them, would you choose to break up with him?""
B: ""no i couldn't do that now, but if i'd have known before i started dating him i probably wouldn't have started to date him ""
A: ""Gotcha, that's understandable. What are your cats' names, by the way?""
B: ""they're called tom and jerry! like from the show""
A: ""Oh, those are excellent names! I wonder how Jerry feels knowing that they're named after a mouse!""
B: ""i think he would enjoy the irony if he knew!""
A: ""Haha, I bet! I wonder if cats can perceive these things. Or maybe identity is too complex--perhaps it's an exclusively human characteristic. ""
B: ""thats a very deep question. i'd argue it would be naive to think its just us that can percieve it""

A: ""Yeah, Saturday and Sunday! We can all go either days and maybe have a drink in our newly renovated shed afterwards and just chill.""
B: ""All of that sounds great to me. When did you finish up the shed?""
A: ""Last week, I just tried helping out my dad. He designed and mostly did the work. I have to take care of my kid so I didn't really have much time to help out. Do you think your husband can make it as well?""

B: ""The rainbow trough is, especially, good but can sometimes be a pain to find. I try to eat healthy because I want to start running soon. Have you run any marathons lately?""

B: ""I am sure. Running seems fun, but difficult when you are trying to train for longer distances. Is there any recommended training I should be doing to prepare myself.""
A: ""Just be realistic with yourself. You're not going to go from not running to running a 5 minute mile. Running a mile at first is a big accomplishment, even if it's 10 minutes or something. ""
B: ""I understand that completely. I love celebrating the small wins. I have been feeling stressed lately, so I figured running would be a good outlet. As a life coach, what advice do you give your clients when they are stressed.""
A: ""It's a great outlet for stress. Nothing makes me feel more calm and ready to take on a challenge than a workout. The best thing you can do is find a good outlet for stress and mix that in with your daily life. ""
B: ""That is some good advice. I do feel calm and more focused when I exercise. There are also the amazing health benefits too. Is it harder to run now, after beating cancer?  I am sure that takes a huge toll on the body.""

A: ""Its my BA but i think i will continue to get my Masters. Enough about me heh, hows your work outs going? The new machine good?""

A: ""I try to hit the gym when i can but ive been so busy. I usually at least try to get a run in every day though. Helps with the stress.""
B: ""Running can be great, at times I've been a runner. Used to be 3 miles, 3 x a week, goal was 10 miles a week. What's your distance like?""
A: ""I think the path i take is about 2.5miles. So i usually try to get in one round before or after school.""
B: ""That is a good amount, as it's enough to get your heart rate up to be sure. Many times, I have to be mindful of schedule and location, as it impacts how consistent I am. Bet you have favorite parts of the path. I love setting up goals to run past. ""
A: ""I do have some favorite trails but the path i take is around my apartment. Its close so i can get it done.""
B: ""Location, and being close, that's helps my exercise. Although many times, just keeping up with the kids will give you plenty of exercise!""

A: ""well 6 is better than zero.  Ive been missing my runs the past few days, been busy with school.""
B: ""School must be stressful since it's your final year. It's hard to stick to a good exercise routine when life is constantly getting in the way.""

A: ""Good afternoon. I hope you are well and healthy.""
B: ""I am. Just thinking about taking my bike out for a spin""
A: ""That sounds lovely. Are you an athlete?""
B: ""Not really. I do race my bike though.""
A: ""Wow. I wish my grandchildren were interested in something similar. But they like smartphones.""
B: ""That seems to be the thing now. So expensive too""
A: ""True. And I've come to know a great life does not come from expensive things.""
B: ""So tre. I just wish I didn't have to wait tables to get extra money.""
A: ""Its all tedious at first dear, but I know it will get better for you.""
B: ""I guess it just really want to be out on my red bike.""
A: ""Sounds like a true joy. I'm retired now, so you are inspiring me to try that.""
B: ""Awesome. Maybe we could go out riding together.""
A: ""I would love that. Life is too short to miss out on making new friends.""
B: ""I have to go, talk to you later.""
A: ""Are you part of a team that compete in bike races or do you compete individually?""
B: ""I compete individually I started doing it as a teenager. How many grandchildren do you have?""
A: ""I have four currently with another on the way. It is such a joy to be able to spend time with them. They are all so sweet.""
B: ""That's great to hear! By any chance, if one of them is interested in learning to ride bikes I would be happy to teach them.""
A: ""I have a grandson who is getting to the age where he is taking the training wheels off and I think he would love that. He's a wild one, so I bet he'd love to learn.""
B: ""Start them young! I can start teaching him as soon as he's out of training wheels. I hope I can meet your other grandchildren as well, you can bring them to the cafe I'm working at as a waiter. I would love to treat them to some hot choco.""
A: ""I will bring them by the next time they stay over at my house for the weekend. They love getting out and about and meeting new people.""
B: ""That's great!! Let me know the next time they are over. What did you do after retirement?""
A: ""For a while I just relaxed and got used to not working and spent a lot of time with family. I'm starting to think about new hobbies and getting into traveling now though. I just don't want to get bored.""
B: ""Yeah its the time to relax and unwind. You remember me of my grandad, I should visit him soon and show him my red bike. I have a competition next time, and I want to invite you.""
A: ""I would love to come! Just tell me when and where and I will be there!""
B: ""I am super excited! I'll invite my grandad too. Maybe you guys can get along. He's also retired.""
A: ""How many bike races have you won?""
B: ""Quite a few actually! It was my life as a kid, and now my career as an adult. Do you think you'd get one of your grandkids into it, as the training wheels are coming off?""
A: ""A lot of it, is listening to the kid, seeing where they are strong, and what they are interested in. I want to make sure my grand kids know how to use the breaks before I let them go on their own!  Love teaching confidence gradually to them. ""
B: ""That's great! How old is your bike riding grandkid?""
A: ""He's just started school and is getting down the alphabet and the like. Need to find something to focus all that energy on. Do you have a workout routine for biking, regularly?""
B: ""I do - a few miles every day in general, but when I'm training it's far more. I also do a lot of leg work. You may be interested in some biking holidays, actually, if you're looking for something like that.""
A: ""Ah, something that might get the kid interested perhaps. If it's something that makes you happy, sure feel free to share the biking holidays!""
B: ""My favourite 'track' (though not really a track exactly) is along the Venice Boardwalk. So much space, all that sea air!""
A: ""Sounds intriguing. Do you plan your vacations around nice places to bike? I bet Europe would have a few great treks. Riding a bike in my neighborhood, that's just fine too. Where was your last holiday?""
B: ""I do sometimes, but not always. Sometimes I like to have a chance to simply walk around. My last holiday was to Milan. The food is exquisite, as is the architecture. What about you?""
A: ""I tend to stay within my region generally, and many times the kids help figure out the destinations. Been thinking about the new season, there are some great forests to explore for hiking and biking. ""
B: ""Sometimes the best places are right on our doorstep - that sounds amazing. Got any favourites specifically?""
A: ""Do you bike to work at the cafe?""
B: ""Yes, most days I do.  If it's raining I don't because I need to not be sopping wet at work.  But otherwise that's my preferred way to commute.""
A: ""That's good. It's an environmentally friendly way to get to work! I'm glad you're reducing your carbon footprint.""
B: ""Yes, I definitely try to do that.  It can be a faster way to travel anyway.  Traffic around here can be pretty gnarly.""
A: ""Certainly. Sounds like you're pretty comfortable being on a bike, too, so that must be a plus.""
B: ""Yes, for sure.  Say, before you said that you were retired.  What did you used to do for a living?""
A: ""I was a petroleum engineer, ironically. I'd go out to oil fields and offshore rigs and help design the processes used for petroleum extraction.""
B: ""Oh wow, that's amazing.  Did you have a degree in petroleum engineering?  Or chemical engineering?""
A: ""I got a degree in chemical engineering. Many schools didn't offer degrees in petroleum engineering back in the day.""
B: ""Interesting.  I remember seeing a list of degrees and what their starting salaries were and chemical engineering was very high on the list.  I remember that because my uncle was a chemical engineer and he seemed to get paid pretty well.""
A: ""Yep, it's a very high-paying job. The oil & gas industry is pretty far away from God's work, but it is lucrative,""
B: ""That's what my uncle used to say, too!  They don't teach you to say that in school, do they?""

B: ""We got up a five a.m. and took a 3 mile jaunt all around our neighborhood. It was great exercise and a great way to start the day! How did your day start today?""
A: ""You're shaming us mortals with that routine!  I rolled out of bed, grabbed a cup of coffee, and watched the goats frolic while the sun came up.  Are you working today? ""

A: ""I haven't! I'm still obsessed with Call of Duty. Maybe that one could be my next video game. ""
B: ""It's a little bit like Skyrim if it were set in the actual Middle Ages and no magic.  Since you like Fallout, I think you will like it.  I wish I was better at COD, but I just die so fast!""
A: ""Haha that used to be me in COD, until I started playing daily and getting good. I'll give that game a try! Is gaming one of your favourite things to do?""
B: ""I don't always have time, but I do enjoy it when I can.  I guess I'm just so focused on my boyfriend.  Do you have a significant other and is it serious?""

B: ""There was a festival downtown a couple years ago.  He saw my car and asked me about it.  Then we spent the rest of the time together.  We really hit it off. How about your husband?""
A: ""How romantic!! That's a good first meeting story. My husband and I met at the dog park. Our golden labs used to play together and I always thought he was cute. He eventually asked me for my number and we hit it off!""

B: ""It's going pretty well. Kindergarteners can be exhausting sometimes, but it's an extremely rewarding job, and I feel very lucky to play an important role in these kids' formative years. You know, speaking of donuts, maybe I can bring some to class. I bet my kids will go crazy for them.""
A: ""I'm sure they would! You could tell them all about the dog park. Maybe it will help you decide on what kind of dog to get.""

A: ""Do your kids ever give you recommendations on the next video game you should play?""
B: ""Not really, and only because I haven't told them much about my video game habits. I'm afraid Call of Duty is a bit too violent for kids this age. Now, if I taught 5th grade, I'm sure I'd share, and I'm sure they'd give me some excellent suggestions.""

B: ""I liked kickball A LOT at your age. Wow, $25 a week!!!!!!!!! I only got $1/week at that age. Wow. What do you do with your allowance, generally! ""
A: ""Only a dollar? I could only buy one candy bar with that. My parents make me save $10 of it, and I buy snacks and drinks from the school vending machine with the rest.""
B: ""If you don't mind advice, I'd save more of it. Either long term for important things like college, or even for toys or video games or whatever -- soda and snacks are a waste.""
A: ""Is buying soda and snacks really a waste? I like them, though. Maybe I'll save money for when we go to Disney World this summer. I can't wait to meet Mickey and Minnie Mouse!""
B: ""Wow, Disney world! You'll have so much fun!""
A: ""I hope so! Have you ever been there?""

B: ""I visited a lot of civil war battlefields like manassas and gettysburg because my father was a big civil war buff. ""
A: ""That sounds fun. What did you like the best about 3rd grade?""
B: ""I liked reading more challenging books and making friendships with other kids. Do you have any friends in the 3rd grade?""
A: ""I have a lot of friends in my grade. Do you have a lot of friends being 20?""
B: ""I have about four or five close friends, but it's harder to make friends at this age, especially when you're not in school. I've been thinking about joining a kickball team to make more friends.""
A: ""Can you join a kickball team without being in school? I play kickball, but I play at school. Do you play basketball?""
B: ""There are kickball teams for grown-up, although we can't play as often because we have to schedule around people's jobs. I used to play basketball when I was younger, but not anymore. Are you good at basketball?""
A: ""I'm okay at basketball, but I am better at kickball. ""
B: ""I like kickball because there is not as much running as there is in basketball. I do not like to run.""
A: ""I like to run, but I'm not very good at running and dribbling the basketball. That's why I like kickball better.""
B: ""Are any of your kickball buddies going with you to disneyland this summer?""
A: ""Did you find a kickball team to join?""
B: ""Yes, our local park district offers one.  We start next week""
A: ""Do you know anyone who's going to be on the team?  Either way this should be a good way to make new friends.""
B: ""I know one other person, so that should be fun.  I can't wait to meet the other people that like the sports I like!  How's school going for you?""
A: ""I am doing alright in school but now I'm struggling in math.  We just got introduced to long division and I don't really understand it.""
B: ""Oh, long division is tough at first, but keep at it and you'll get it.  New things are hard to learn sometimes.  Is there a friend or someone that can help you ? ""
A: ""I tried to ask my parents but I didn't understand what they said to me and they started arguing with each other so I left.  Maybe I'll ask my friend Josh at school tomorrow.  He's pretty good at math.""
B: ""Oh wow.  That shouldn't have sparked an argument.  Sorry to hear that.  But yea, I'd say talk to Josh.  Maybe he can give you a different way of looking at it than your teacher explained and it will be easier for you to understand. Have you played kickball recently?""
A: ""We played it at recess today.  It was so fun.  I only got to kick once but I got a double so I was happy with that.  How many times a week is your team going to play?""
B: ""Just once a week for games, but I'm sure our team will get together for practices when we can.  Everyone works or goes to school so we have to work around those schedules.""
A: ""Yes, I can understand.  At school we have a hard time getting everyone organized to play at recess or lunch, and we all have the same schedule.  What position do you want to play in the field?  I like to play first base.""

So we can start by just doing some stationary moves with our upper-bodies, and then get more dynamic the more comfortable you feel.  And there are no wrong moves as far as I'm concerned.""
A: ""i'm very excited i like that there is no worng way to do it. how long have you been teaching?""
B: ""Well, I've never taught dance formally.  I've just taken classes.  But I do show other people some moves whenever they're interested.  Having a dance studio would be a dream of mine but that's a very long ways off.""
A: ""that would be amazing i hope one day you achieve your goal""
B: ""Thank you, that's very kind.  What was your dream when you were a little girl?""
A: ""i would love my own restaurant i am a big foodi""
B: ""That would be really cool, although restaurants are tough work.  What type of food do you think you'd serve?""
A: ""definetely mexican im really good at making it""

B: ""Wow! That is impressive. Swimming or running?""
A: ""Running. And I also do gymnastics it is my fave""
B: ""Nice. I prefer hiking and rock climbing myself. Living in co is great for those.""
A: ""Nice I love enjoy italian food and garlic bread""
B: ""Me too. I often go to company dinners at italian restaurants. What is your favorite dish?""
A: ""That is awesome. I love chicken alfredo""
B: ""Delicious choice. I love coming home from work to a nice plate of that.""
A: ""It is and I do enjoy it a lot.""
B: ""I work as a mechanical engineer so I do not know a lot about gymnastics.""

B: ""I'm sure. Have you ever been to colorado?""
A: ""No I've never been to colorado""
B: ""I live there, you'll have to come visit sometime. Great trails for running.""
A: ""I might be going to Colorado for a gymnastics tournament!""
B: ""I still am so impressed that you won a gold medal. We should get together soon and meet up at a great Italian restaurant. Would you like to do that?""
A: ""I'd love to!  That sounds wonderful!  Know of anywhere I can get some good garlic bread?  I think that's my favorite part of any Italian restaurant!""
B: ""Well when you get to Colorado we can meet. I just need to get a sate you will be here. Since yo may be coming to Colorado I can drive pretty much anywhere in the state to meet you consideing you will have travelled a ways to get to Colorado. I know of a bunch of great places that have delicious garlic bread. I live near Aspen. Do you know if you will be flying into Aspen or Denver?""
A: ""I was thinking Denver but I could probably fly into Aspen if it's easier.  I don't want you to have to drive too far!  Denver just seemed to have more flights and be a bigger airport but I think that they were the same price!  I'm not sure when it will be.  I'm hoping next month.  How's the weather in Colorado in May?""
B: ""Yeah Denver is HUGE! It is also very beautiful. The weather is really warm in May- not too hot- not too cold. We can also go hiking if you want- I rock climb in a place not too far from Denver. I may not be much of a gymnast but i can climb a rock like a pro. ""
A: ""I've gotten a bit out of shape since my Olympic days but I think I could still handle a good hike!  It would probably be good for me to get some high intensity exercise in!  I've been a bit lazy lately and after all that garlic bread and alfredo sauce I'm going to need to do something to burn off some calories!!  What's the highest mountain you've hiked?""
B: ""Oh- I thought you were coming to Colorado for a gymnastics tournament. Are you a participant of a coach now? When you were in the Olympics what was you strong point? I mean did you do floor routine- bars or horse. I think it is called horse-lol- but I know so little about gymnastics so I may be wrong. ""
A: ""Floor was always my strong event.  I loved to tumble!  I'm a coach now!  I just tell other people to do the hard work and I stand back and watch!  Which is how I've gotten a little out of shape!  People call the vault a variety of things - horse is one of them!  I've competed on beam and bars too but floor will always have my heart!""
B: ""Haha- yeah I guess with your love of Italian food you probably are better off coaching. And as far as you previous question about the highest mountain I have hikes- I really do not climb high mountains as I rock climb but I have hiked to the top of  Crestone Peak Mountain in Colorado. It took a lot out of me and like you, I am not in as good a shape as I used to be. ""
A: ""I bet the view was amazing though!  Do you ever get altitude sickness?  I always hear about that with people who climb up to high points in Colorado!""
B: ""The view was amazing! No I never get altitude sickness- knock on wood- I think because I took so freaking long getting to the top that my body acclimated to the higher altitude. So let me know when you will be coming so I can make plans on meeting up with you. I can hardly wait to see you!""
A: ""I booked my flight to Aspen for next month!""
B: ""That's fantastic! Is that for the tournament? How long will you be there?""
A: ""It is, I'm really looking forward to it! I booked the hotel for 5 nights.  Any sites you recommend I visit during the trip?""
B: ""If you like hiking there's lots of great places. I like Crater Lake Trail. It's also good for running. if you don't mind some hills""
A: ""Actually, I love running on hilly terrain! I'm a little worried about the altitude though since I'm quite in the same shape I used to be.  Is it really that much harder running in the mountains?""
B: ""That's a good question. I've always lived here so I guess I'm used to it but if you aren't used to it, it can be rough. Then again, you are in good condition so as long as you pace yourself you probably will be okay. ""
A: ""Yeah I probably will need to take it easy.  That'll be hard for me though because I know I'm going to be so amped up from the tournament that it'll be hard to contain that extra energy.""
B: ""if the weather's nice you can go boating on the lake. It's relaxing but it still uses energy for rowing. Too bad it's not ski weather, do you ski?""
A: ""I've never gone skiing before, but it sounds really exciting! Is there a place you recommend?""
B: ""Snowmass is one of the big ones but it gets crowded. I haven't been up there in a while. Maybe you can come back in the winter and we can explore together""
A: ""That might be a better idea.  I'll be busy with the tournament during the day, and I don't know when the slopes close in the evening.  I'll see how I like the area and I can let you know about a winter trip!""
B: ""that sounds good. If you have some time while you're here this time maybe we can meet for coffee (or an energy smoothie!)""
A: ""I was watching some skiing videos. It looks like so much fun!""
B: ""Yes, It's fantastic!  You'll really enjoy it once you have a chance to try it!""
A: ""I am very excited about my trip even more so now. With living in Colorado you must get to go all the time. What do prefer more skiing or rock climbing? ""
B: ""I like skiing more, but i usually find more time for rock climbing.  Have you ever done rock climbing?""
A: ""I have done indoor rock climbing but never the real thing. It scares me that i might not attach the equipment properly and fall. ""
B: ""When you come to Colorado, if you want to try it I can show you the ropes.  You are such a gifted athlete though you'll probably be great at it!  ""
A: ""Omg that would be fantastic. Thank you so much. This vacation just keeps on getting better. Have you been able to do any rock climbing yourself lately? ""
B: ""Yes, just last weekend!  I haven't been skiing for a couple of months though.  I'm anxious to get on the slopes again.""
A: ""Oh nice i bet you had a great time. Well maybe you can join me then if your free we can make a day of it some skiing and some rock climbing. ""
B: ""Sure! Of course, then you'll probably wind up winning a gold medal in the winter olympics too!""

B: ""I mostly rode around on my bike, the beach was very relaxing and breezy. I then took a bit time of later to eat some food at a local restaurant that sells good seafood.""
A: ""What did you get? ""
B: ""I got the shrimp plate, which is grilled shrimp coated in garlic. I also had it with some fried squid as well.""
A: ""Oh, I love squid. I like to get it breaded and fried. I also really like garlic shrimp. How was it? ""
B: ""It was really tasty and well worth the money. I normally don't get to eat seafood at my apartment, but I really enjoy the times I get to eat it at a restaurant.""
A: ""Yeah, I don't often eat seafood at home, but I love to get it when I'm out too. How has school been going for you? ""
B: ""Its been going well, I feel I have gotten accust to studying from home. My computer set up is well suited for online classes, and my internet connection isn't too bad either.""

B: ""I'm really glad to hear that. Being with nature is certainly a calming and refreshing experience.""

A: ""They'll only bite if the don't like you!  Haha, I'm kidding, but I can keep them in the backyard while we work if you don't want to interact with them.  Were you ever afraid of your black lab back when he was around?""
B: ""Not him specifically. Other dogs do scare me. You never know how they are being trained. Peoples beliefs can translate to how they groom their pets to be.""
A: ""Yeah, that's very true.  Some people don't treat their pets with any respect, so it's not surprising when they lash out.  I promise my dogs are well-trained, but I can still keep them away just in case.""
B: ""That sounds good. Thank you for understanding. What is it like to be a Pagen?""
A: ""It's very freeing, I like not being tied down by what others expect of me.  I'm still spiritual, but I don't feel obliged to act ritualistically.""
B: ""That makes a lot of sense. I feel the same about practicing the Left Hand Path. There is nothing more freeing than following your own path and not the ones others try to pave for you.""
A: ""So did you want to come over this weekend and I can show you around an engine? i've been reading more about the left hand path, it's really interesting!""
B: ""I would be happy to come over and learn more about how to fix cars. Its really interesting to hear more about it, I am jealous of those that can repair their own cars.""

B: ""That would be great. What year is your mustang, and when did you get it. Was it in working order when you first bought it or was it in need of a good repair job?""
A: ""I bought it last year with my Stimulus Money. Its a 1967 fastback. It wasn't running so I got it for real cheap! I plan on painting it fire engine red. ""
B: ""Red is a lovely color for a car. I wouldn't mind giving my Mazda a new paint job when I get the chance. Did you have another car before buying your mustang?""
A: ""I did, it was a 2000 Ford Mustang GT-8. Driving it was part of the reason why I wanted to get one of the older ones. I loved it! What color is your Mazda now? I have all the painting stuff, if you want we could paint it soon?""
B: ""My Mazda currently is a blueish grey, it came as it is when I bought it used. I don't think the previous owner painted it before, so I think it would be fine if I gave it a new paint job. Is it hard to paint a vehicle like mine?""
A: ""Not really. Its more time consuming and messy, but it can be kind of fun. What color would you want to paint it? Would you want it more metallic and shiny or just a single standard color?""
B: ""I think a metallic color would be cool for my Mazda, I was thinking something along the lines of an indigo color. Would you recommend a metallic or matte?""
A: ""I think indigo and a metallic shine/finish would look cool! Matte is always so boring to me. ""
B: ""Then a metallic indigo sounds good for my Mazda. I have also been considering installing a spoiler to my car, do you have experience doing that kind of installation?""
A: ""I just finished reading the sequel to the 'Left Hand Path', I think you would like it. Would you like to borrow it?""

A: ""I do my best, but I am not perfect. How directly do you follow it?""
B: ""For me, the left-hand path seeks a ""higher law"" based on knowledge and power. It is the way of self-empowerment and true freedom, in my opinon. What do you like about it?""
A: ""I enjoy the pursuit of knowledge. Truly knowing what I am following and trusting in that path. Are you learning any new languages at the moment?""
B: ""I am fluent in english, of course, and also spanish and french. I know you're not keen on learning new languages, but is there a reason for that?""
A: ""I feel self-conscience when I talk to a native speaker of that language. I do not want to feel like I am being judged. How do you become fluent and comfortable speaking another language?""
B: ""That's an understandable fear, but I can tell you from personal experience, when you travel, most people really appreciate that you even make the effort to say a few things in their native language. Practice is the key to becoming fluent.""
A: ""I think you're right. I think I need to plan a trip to a country in about six months, and then spend that time studying their language. Maybe if I immerse myself in it, I will not be so nervous.""
B: ""That's a terrific idea, and I think you'll have a lot of fun learning a new language. By the way, how are Dixon and Sirius doing?""

B: ""We went to this place called turning point near us, it was beautiful! Our hike for this weekend is planned for a place about an hour from us. Have you been on any hikes recently? ""
A: ""I was planning one for this weekend at a local state park.  It has some waterfalls that suppose to be amazing.  I am excited to go and spend some time on me.  A late birthday present for myself.""
B: ""That sounds so beautiful and relaxing. Yes you deserve it! How was your birthday, happy belated by the way!""
A: ""Thank you.  It was good.  I got to spend some time with family and a few friends that I have not seen in awhile.  We went to a great burger place.  It was awesome.  The hamburger had a fried egg on it.  Have you ever had one with egg?""
B: ""Oh wow that sounds unreal. No I haven't but now i'm gonna have to get one this weekend! I'm glad you had a good birthday though. ""
A: ""Yes, you should.  I was unsure at first but when I bit into it, it was really good.  What other plans do you have for this weekend?""
B: ""Yummy! We're planning on getting a nice bite to eat after our hike so I'm defiantly suggesting a place that has a burger like that! Other than that no other plans. How about yourself? ""
A: ""Just want to relax and enjoy the beauty of outdoors. We both sound like we have great weekends planned.  We should get together one weekend and do a hike.""
B: ""Absolutely, I would love that! Do you know if you are free for next weekend?""
A: ""My ex boyfriend tried to take my piranha while I went for a hike. The fish bit him.""
B: ""Oh my gosh, how did your ex boyfriend enter your place? Is he okay?""
A: ""He still had a key. I made him give it back!!! He was smart enough to wear gloves so he didn't get hurt. I'm just glad he didn't hurt the fish! I took the key back and am changing the locks. ""
B: ""I'm glad he didn't get hurt but that is so crazy! I'm glad you're changing the locks. Aside from that, how was your hike? Where'd you go hiking?""
A: ""I went in a park near me on Staten Island, High Rock Park. It has lots of trails and a nature preserve. Where are you going to hike this weekend?""
B: ""We're planning on going to a place about an hour away up north. It's about an hour drive from here but the trails there are incredible. How long were the trails? I'm looking at doing something that has some climbing nearby as well.""
A: ""Took my friend and me about 2 hours to hike this one but we were going slow at some points. It was a nice hike.""
B: ""That sounds great! Not too long at all. What was the view at high rock park like? Are there tables and observation areas where you can have a picnic? ""
A: ""Have you found a place to climb?""
B: ""We've actually had to cancel our trip because my boyfriend got really sick.  I'm so bummed about it.""
A: ""Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that. Have you rescheduled it for another time?""
B: ""Not yet.  I figure I'm going to spend the weekend nursing him back to health, and then we'll worry about hiking and climbing when he's better.  Are you actively looking for a new boyfriend right now?  Or are you staying single for a while?""
A: ""That's a good idea. I'm probably going to stay single for a while. I don't want to get into another relationship after having just gotten out of one.""
B: ""Yes, and it sounds like it ended badly.  Sometimes it's good to say independent for a while and figure out what you really want.  I had a really bad breakup before my current boyfriend and I spent some time finding myself and then my new boyfriend came along when I wasn't even looking.""
A: ""Haha, maybe that'll be my experience as well. I'm just going to stay out of it, and if someone comes along, great! If nobody comes along, then I don't mind being single for a little while longer either.""
B: ""That sounds like a good plan.  How long have you had a piranha, by the way?  That's a very unique pet!""
A: ""I've had it for about a year, which is also about as long as I've been single for. Guess I needed something to keep me company.""
B: ""You didn't want to get something more cuddly?!  I have a cat.  She causes me some trouble but she's also very warm at times.""
A: ""Cats are cuddly, but I'm afraid it'll scratch me to death. Piranhas are vicious, sure, but as long as I don't dip my hand into the water, it won't do anything to me. ""
B: ""Yes, that's true.  What do you feed it?""

B: ""Greetings, I like fish, not chips, what is your trabajo? Work""
A: ""I am a college student. Art major.""
B: ""I am unable to go out, too busy studying, lots on my plate, art? I like music""
A: ""Cool. Speaking of plates, I do love making paella""
B: ""Who is your favorite artist? Mine is wagner, do you speak espanol? Love paella!""
A: ""No spanish. Which is surprising for a descendant of christopher columbus!""
B: ""You love food! All I do is study, spanish now, french next, in between music""
A: ""I try to visit europe twice yearly. You should come with me then!""

B: ""Take medicine, sounds fun, let us go? You pay, okay?""
A: ""What type of music do you like listening to?""
B: ""I like Tool the band that is my favorite by far. I consider them to be a genre all on their own kind of hard to put them into a category. ""
A: ""Ah cool. Yeah it's always hard for me to classify the genre of artists. If it isn't clearly pop or rap I usually just call it ""alternative"" haha. So do you play any instruments?""
B: ""No sadly I don't play any, I had fiddled around playing an electric guitar for a few months but I never stayed interested enough in it to keep at it. How about you? Do you play any instruments?""
A: ""Ah, so do you mostly study music theory in school? Or do you sing? I don't play anything, I learned piano for a few years when I was a kid but was terrible at it haha""
B: ""I don't sing or play any music at all, just like you. You're related to Christopher Columbus? That's actually really cool how did you find that out? I've never had a genealogy report before.  ""
A: ""I found out from my parents, I never got a formal report but stories got carried down the generations. It'd be cool to do one of those though, see if there are any other mystery relatives I have""
B: ""Yeah, that's something you should get done. I want to get one done too, it could be very exciting finding out your ancestor was someone very famous who changed the world. It could turn out though to be pretty boring. That's probably what would happen for me, I'd be related to nobodies. You mentioned you liked making Paella what is that? ""
A: ""Haha well you never know! Paella is a spanish dish, mainly in Valencia. It has rice and usually seafood. I fell in love with it when I went to Spain and decided to learn how to make it. Do you cook much? ""
B: ""No I don't do much cooking, I am a TV dinner kind of guy. It's too easy for me to pop something in the oven and come back 40 minutes later and chow down so I don't do much cooking. Do you like cooking things other than paella?  ""
A: ""That makes sense, I'm definitely like that with some things where it's just easier to get it done with. I go through phases where I get obsessed with cooking certain things, so right now it's mainly paella, but recently I was trying out different pizza doughs""
B: ""I didn't even know there was different kind of pizza doughs, can you explain some of the different types? I am curious now. ""
A: ""Could you teach me some phrases in Spanish?""
B: ""Of course! Would you like to start with some basic phrases?""
A: ""I would love to know how to say some things related to food for the next time I visit Spain.""
B: ""That's a great idea! How about... ""Va a ser un refresco y dos tacos."" Can you guess what that means?""
A: ""Hmm, something like I would like a drink and two tacos? I'm really bad with language learning.""
B: ""That's right! You'll pick up the language in no time. When's your next holiday to Spain?""
A: ""Is it hard knowing/learning two languages like you are? I hope to visit again in the summer depending on airfare and family obligations.""
B: ""It can be hard, but if you practice a little every day, you'll soon start recognising words and phrases. It's all about becoming comfortable with the language. That sounds good - where in Spain do you want to visit next?""
A: ""We have family in Barcelona, it's crazy seeing my extended family.  I've always wanted to go to Seville or Madrid though!""
B: ""I bet! I visited Seville a couple of years ago - it's fantastic, and the food is so tasty there!""
A: ""That's good to hear, I guess that means I have to go now!""
B: ""Absolutely! There's lots to do there - some great architecture and lots to visit. And it'll be a great chance to practice your Spanish!""
A: ""I'm trying to decide between visiting Seville or Madrid when I go to Spain, and it's not easy!""
B: ""i have been to madrid and it is really cool but i think seville is more beautiful""
A: ""So which one would you actually recommend if I could only go to one?""
B: ""if i had to decide i'd pick seville its a better place to relax ""
A: ""That sounds fun.  I'll have other chances in the future to visit Madrid, too, so I think I'll go to Seville.  I'll have to see if my relatives from Barcelona want to meet me there.""
B: ""oh wow you have relatives in barcelona? i would reccomend visiting it is my favourite place in spain""
A: ""Yes, I visited them in their home before.  Barcelona is definitely an amazing city.  But I'd prefer to see something different, although I shouldn't visit Spain without seeing my relatives, too.  I assume you saw the Sagrada Familia?  What did you think of it?""
B: ""its an incredible building it will be amazing to see it when it is completed ""
A: ""Yes, I find it amazing that it's been in construction for over 100 years.  That sort of boggles my mind.""
B: ""its very close to completion now! it is mind boggling""

B: ""Her name was Zoey.  What makes you like cats so much?""
A: ""That's a lovely name! I like that they are independent, means i can spend all day at the construction yard if i have to. What did you do before retiring?""
B: ""I was a tailor.   I worked for a bridal shop altering dresses for weddings.  You should see some of the amazing dresses I've seen!  Now I just spend my days at the casino!  That's why I haven't gotten another dog!  My tailor job was so flexible I could work when I wanted to as long as I got the dresses done in time so I'd always be home to feed and let Zoey out!""
A: ""Oh yes that's right. I'd love to see some of the dresses i bet they were amazing! Have you considered getting a cat? You could still go to the casino and he/she would be fine on their own for a bit?""
B: ""I thought about it.  I've just never had a cat so I don't know much about taking care of them.  I've heard they scratch up furniture.  Is that true?""
A: ""Well yes i suppose they do but they can be taught not to as they get older, lots of people keep them outside in catteries, that could be an option. At least you could grill without worrying about a cat burglar nicking your sausages.""
B: ""That is true!  Although Zoey was so small she couldn't get up to the grill!  I'm partial to tiny dogs!  What is a cattery?""
A: ""Looks like I will have to work overtime next week. I need to find someone to come play with my cats in the middle of the day so they don't get too bored.""
B: ""Oh I can come over and play with them.""

A: ""Oh my goodness!! Is that your biggest win?""
B: ""Not quite, but it's definitely in the top 5.  I was thinking of taking some of it and donating it to the animal shelter.  What do you think?""
A: ""Awe I love the ASPCA. I got my last kitty from the local shelter. That's so nice of you.""
B: ""I was thinking that I could look at the animals when I go in.  I'm so lonely sometimes that I might be ready to get another pet.  I still can't decide if I want a cat or another little dog though.  After Zoey passed away, it was so difficult.""
A: ""A kitty might be fresh change after the loss of Zoey. I have found cats easier than dogs to care for. You should get another pet for companionship. Do you plan on going in soon t the shelter?""
B: ""Yes, I was thinking I would go tomorrow.  If I don't, there's too much of a chance I'll end up back at the casino.""
A: ""Well then get right into the shelter for a donation and hopefully an adoption lol. It could really lift your spirits. Any plans for dinner tonight?""
B: ""I was thinking lasagna.  Italian is always my favorite thing to cook.  What about you?""
A: ""I was actually going to try grilling and was going to ask for some tips. I am thinking grilled chicken should be easy, right?""
B: ""It's pretty easy.  Do you have a gas or charcoal grill?  I usually work with a gas grill.  Make sure to marinade the chicken for a while first, that way the flavor soaks in.  I also like to put the seasoning on right when the meat hits the grill.  It really builds up the flavor profile.""

B: ""I tip well to compensate him for the pain and suffering he endures from bringing me my unholy pineapple pizza, I do ride Charlie, sometimes. Other times, I just pet him, and we graze together. (On different things, of course.)""
A: ""I bet you could have a great social media following for Charlie, the pineapple eating pony. Have you thought about introducing him on any of those mediums?""
B: ""I haven't thought of that before. Maybe that's something I could consider. Maybe I can show off my pineapple pizza alongside it, too. I wonder if that'll boost its reputation, haha.""

B: ""Yes, and it also helps with depression I have found.""
A: ""Yes I wish I knew that before when I was a teenager""
B: ""Me too, it is good to know. Spread the word to others. Better than any medication.""
A: ""Yes it is I never thought about it but I just might thanks for the idea""
B: ""No problem. Always here to help a friend.""
A: ""So what else do you like to do on your spare time?""
B: ""Oh, I like to spend time with my cat, nelly.""
A: ""How is your cat doing?""
B: ""My cat loves cuddling and sleeping in my lap. She is so chill.""
A: ""Is she sleeping in your lap right now? What is her name?""
B: ""Yes, she is. Her name is Brandy. I named her after the Looking Glass song.""
A: ""Oh, I love that song! Have you gone for a run today?""
B: ""I ran this morning around the neighborhood. I like feeling the cold misty air on my sweaty face when I run.""
A: ""I know right!? I enjoy running early in the morning as well. How far do you usually run?""
B: ""I usually run until I can feel the sweat run down my back or I just miss my cat and wanna play with her again.""
A: ""Hm, for me that would not be very far, but I sweat a lot. How old is your cat?""
B: ""My cat is sweet 16. She is so pretty with her gray hairs.""
A: ""Wow! She has been around for a long time. Have you had her for her whole life?""
B: ""She has been around since I was young but not my whole life. But I have been around for her whole life though. I hope I can be a great parent for her.""
A: ""I would love to see a picture of your cat if you have one to hand?""
B: ""I don’t have one right now.  I lost my phone when I was shoe shopping last week.""
A: ""Oh no, do you think it was stolen?""
B: ""I think it fell out of my purse at some point.  I’m so mad, my running place list was on it too.  I’ll have to make a new playlist.  Do you have any song recommendations? What do you like to listen to when you run?""
A: ""I'm sorry to hear that! Oh yes, I have to listen to music when I'm running - it really gets me in the zone! I know I recommended my favourite song, Brandy by Looking Glass, to you in the past, but I love any uptempo rock songs when I'm running! What about you?""
B: ""I have a few other songs by looking glass that I like. I also like upbeat songs for running, but sometimes I really want to distract my mind and listen to audiobooks.""
A: ""Yeah, I know what you mean - I like listening to audiobooks too. I'm currently listening to a Terry Pratchett one - what about you?""
B: ""The last book I listened to was the Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy.""
A: ""That's a great one, I read that when I was younger - it's really funny! Did you enjoy it?""
B: ""Yes! But for my next book I think I’ll listen to something in the self help genre.  I was thinking something to help me cope with my depression.""
A: ""That's a really good idea - there's a lot of useful audiobooks available that I think would be really beneficial.""
B: ""I’ve been thinking about becoming a vegetarian to help my health and maybe improve my running.  Do you have any advice on getting started with a vegetarian diet?  ""
A: ""Did you get a new phone? Have you looked into vegetarianism more? How is your cat?""
B: ""Yeah I am picking up my new phone later today. Yeah I have I'm just not 100% sure if its for me so im just going to gradually stop eating certain things. My cat is not doing so well, I think she may pass soon. ""
A: ""Bless your cat, I appreciate you telling me. Also, I understand about gradually changing, and I think that worked for me too. ""
B: ""She has had a great life and will be extremely missed but i hate seeing her in pain. Yeah it really is a massive leap so I think I will make up a plan of what and when I will stop consuming certain things. ""
A: ""For me, it was a spiritual choice I think, to not eat animals. So, I started with beef, and kept chicken and fish for awhile. I like dairy though, and I need cheese sometimes. I appreciate the love you have with that pet. Sounds like they are loved. ""
B: ""See for me I hate the thought of animals being killed for me to eat and then the devil side of me is like but it tastes so good. So i am in an internal battle with myself. ""
A: ""Your feelings make sense. I struggle too. And after a few years, you get used to it. And then when you do eat it, your stomach is like what is this? grumble! I do feel healthier. That too. ""
B: ""Yeah a lot of people do say that they feel so much healthier and that is one of other reasons i want to do it. Especially now when then do so many non-meat items that are plant based. ""
A: ""I think it has to be realistic too. Otherwise I don't stick to the plan. I slip too sometimes. I hope your kitty is comfortable, I'll be thinking about them. ""
B: ""Yeah i will get there in the end. And thank you she is on pain killers but think she will go back to the vets in a few days. ""
A: ""One day at a time, with that kind of work. And grieving too. I need to take a break between pets. And my last pet had an expensive, protracted dying process, and I've taken a break since then. Looking forward to a pet again some day. ""
B: ""Yeah it really does take a toll. They are part of the family, it will be very strange without her around my i won't be getting another one for a long time. ""

B: ""Rebel! You must have a crazy high metabolism.""

B: ""Big is unhealthy. It is not fun.""
A: ""Aww. I am sure all will turn out well for you.""
B: ""Hopefully I will learn stuff in nursing school.""
A: ""Why do you want to become a nurse?""
B: ""I love helping people!  And my mom was a nurse and I was always so proud of her and saw how much the work meant to her!  What made you get into the music industry?""
A: ""Not surprisingly, because I love music. Got lucky that way. Are you you nursing school? I forget.""
B: ""Yes, I'm still in school.  I have one year left.  I can't wait til I'm done.  Working and going to school is so difficult!  I spend all night serving drinks to drunks at a bar and all day in the hospital doing clinicals and then I study until I go to the bar to work again!  It's exhausting!""
A: ""I'd imagine it would be! Kudos to you for balancing the two. I don't think I could do that. Any fun classes right now?""
B: ""I took all my classes the first couple years so now I'm basically just doing the work of a nurse for free in the hospitals!  A licensed nurse just follows me around and tells me what to do and supervises me so I get hands on experience.  It's better than being in a classroom but I can't wait until I can actually get paid to do it!""
A: ""I'd imagine. Honestly, that sounds a like exploitative. You should at least get minimum wage or something!""
B: ""Yeah but instead I have to pay tuition to do it!  It does seem exploitative, doesn't it?  How's your dog doing?""
A: ""She's doing really well! Actually had a client come by the studio yesterday who showed up with a steak from Ruth Chris as just gave it to her. Must be nice to be that rich.""
B: ""Wow!  If I could afford that good of a steak I would most certainly not be sharing it with a dog!!!  Hopefully once I get these student loans paid off someday I can eat like that!  What kind of dog do you have again?  I never remember""
A: ""A lab. She gobbled the thing down. And gave me a look like, ""How come you never feed me anything like that!"" I bet it'll be nice to have those loans paid off.""
B: ""For sure!  Should take a few years though from what I've calculated!  College isn't cheap!  I'm surprised she's even eating her dog food now and not holding out for steak again!  Ha!  I might do that if I realized there was something better out there!""
A: ""Have you encountered any interesting medical cases while doing your nursing work?  In other words, have any of the cases you have been part of been out of the ordinary?""
B: ""Most days in nursing are just routine but there are the occasional things that happen. It is amazing how much strength a small 90 year old woman has while they are confused and medicated. We have to be really careful as they can hurt us.""
A: ""Have you gone surfing again since your shark encounter? ""
B: ""I am not sure what you are referring too. I just work and eat all the time.""
A: ""I thought you were in school to become a nurse like your mother. Is your diet over, I had thought you were eating less?""
B: ""I finish school but I am working as a student now. I am still trying to diet but it is difficult. How are your dogs?""
A: ""My labrador Agatha is doing fantastic. One of my client brought her a new york strip steak last night. She loves to bark at the neighbor's dog. Do they have any therapy dogs at the hospital?""
B: ""Wow your clients really treat your dogs well. Hopefully they also bring you food. Yes there is an organization that will bring dogs to the hospital to sit with the clients. The dogs can't stay in the hospital but it is nice when they come visit.""
A: ""They bring me five guys. I love a cheeseburger almost as much as life itself! Some of my clients are really nice people, other's can be challenging to work with to say the least. Did you like working as a bar tender?""
B: ""Your dogs have more expensive taste than you they must be spoiled. Any job seems to have its challenges with clients. Nursing and bar tending seem like they would be so different but in reality they are both about making people feel comfortable. I made a lot of money as a bar tender and it can be fun sometimes its stressful it depends who the clients are. ""
A: ""Clients and customers can make or break a job. I never thought of the similarities between nursing and bartending in the terms you described. I mix cocktails for some of my clients in between recording sessions. It seems to loosen some of them up. Dirty martinis are my drink of choice. What's your favorite cocktail?""
B: ""I think it is really important to have soft skills no matter what job you are in. Sometimes people are difficult because nobody has taken the time to listen to them its amazing what engaging in friendly conversation with someone can do to a persons mood. Yes a good drink can also help sometimes I like to experiment with drinks I am still working on perfecting one I don't have a favorite but I like to keep trying new things.""
A: ""I'm about to have another cheeseburger.""
B: ""Ohhh, What kind of cheese burger? Like with bacon, or mushrooms and onion... Maybe some Avocado or jalapeno? ""
A: ""One with bacon and a fried egg. Its called the good morning burger. ""
B: ""Ohh that sounds amazing. My favorite one is one of my own creations. I can't have it now because of calorie count. But I put mushrooms, jalapenos, cream cheese, velveeta and rotel tomatoes into my hamburger meat. Then I make sure to use some good tempura batter as the binder and wrap the patty in bacon. ""
A: ""That sounds amazing. But can see why it wouldn't be a good option for you right now. Have you found any low calorie burger options?""
B: ""Well, I have been eating burgers made with lean turkey meat with avocado, lettuce, tomato and a mushroom bun. I also stopped eating fries. Which is depressing. Have you ever tried a mushroom bun?""
A: ""That sounds like you have good options. Even without the fries. I have never had a mushroom bun. I am not a big fan of mushrooms. ""
B: ""Ah well you'd have to be. I put a bit of olive oil and garlic powder on the large top mushrooms and bake them for like 10 mins. Then when they cool off, they work to hold the burger together. The turkey is good for you, but I don't like it. I always season it a lot.""
A: ""Well I am sure all the actions you are taking now will pay off soon for you. Have you been able to see any results yet?""
B: ""I started this journey when the scale said 350. I am only 30 lbs down so far and it has been almost 8 months. But I was not very in control the first 5 months or so and kept gaining it back the moment it was gone.""

A: ""Haha, I always tell everyone I am married to the money! Freedom and travel are my virtues""
B: ""I like money too. Money is the tool for the expression of freedom.""
A: ""I'm sure farming grants you the opportunity to make a lot of money""
B: ""The money I get from farming come from providing people with quality food products. It's a warm and wholesome type of currency.""
A: ""I have just booked my latest trip overseas to Spain, I can't wait to go.""
B: ""That is great what are you planning to do in Spain? Is it a vacation or are you going to look for a wife?""
A: ""It is just a vacation. I plan to do lots of sight seeing and eating. I love good food from small cafes. Do you cook a lot of what you grow on the farm?""
B: ""Almost everything I eat is from the crops I grow on my farm. My favorite thing to make is stew from my potatoe and onion crops. I add some beef to that and it is delicious.""
A: ""That sounds amazing. I travel often, but have never visited a farm before. I think it would be fun to visit your farm , play with your dog, and try your stew. Is it hard running a farm by yourself?""
B: ""It used to be hard but then I got into a routine for planting and tending my crops and now that I have a routine it can get a bit repetitive. I get so tired some days that I wish I could go on a vacation. You're lucky. You get to vacation in Spain. Did it take long to save up the money for that trip?""
A: ""It did take a while, but traveling is worth it. I get to see so many new things and take in so much culture. It can also be exhausting too though, with time changes and not understanding the languages. I think we are both lucky in our own way, doing things we enjoy. I can't have a pet because I travle so much. ""
B: ""I know! Having a dog is great. I love mine so much. But when you want to travel it can be a big hassle because you either have to find a neighbor to watch your dog, or you have to put the dog in a kennel, which can be a lot of money depending on how long you are gone. ""
A: ""I would feel bad leaving a pet with someone. I do enjoy the freedom to get and and leave whenever I feel the urge. I work remotely, so I can work from anywhere. It is so relaxing to take my laptop and work from the beach, or a hotel room. One of my favorite parts of traveling though is the food. Good local food. You must love being able to walk outside, pick fresh food and eat prepare it right away. It must taste so good!""
B: ""I do love doing everything local, and don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade my current life with one where I travel a lot. But every so often, when I talk to people who travel a lot, I get the travel bug. I wish I could go to Spain like you. I think it would be a lot of fun. Oh, I forgot to ask. Are you taking anyone with you to Spain or are you going alone?""
A: ""I am going alone this time. I sometimes travel with family or friends. I get a lot of frequent flyer miles and companion passes. I don't date much because I travel so often, but once and a while I trave with the person I am dating. I guess I find it hard to settle down with a person, not too many people can up and leave their jobs as often as I do. I am looking for someone who wants to live a nomadic lifestyle like I do.""
B: ""Oh, well then I hope you don't mind me asking, but since you have companion passes, do you think I could go along with you? Just as friends of course. We just have so much in common, and I'm at a good stopping point with my work at the farm, that I'd like to go on a vacation at this point. Don't worry, I understand if not. I just thought I'd throw that out there.""
A: ""I downloaded a dating app to find a partner. ""

A: ""Oh yes! I live in the desert so it's quite practical for me. I spend much of my time at home so I really appreciate it.""
B: ""I need to add more solar power to our home. Any ideas where I could start out small?""
A: ""What are some improvements you and your wife have planned for your house?""
B: ""We haven't really thought about home improvements for awhile. I suppose it is time to get a new roof. Do you have a solar roof? I am not sure if they have those here it rains a lot.""
A: ""We do have solar energy, but we also live in the desert. Lots of sun here, haha.""
B: ""Does your house stay warm at night? How do you get your organic food in the dessert?""
A: ""I guess the same way anyone else does...at the grocery store. The house stays warm enough at night. It can cool off quite a bit compared to day time temperatures. I really enjoy my home.""
B: ""Oh I meant does food grow in the dessert or is it all imported? Are you working on any interesting project in your home?""
A: ""Some times it grows in winter, but summer is hard on vegetables""
B: ""Do you grow anything at home?""
A: ""Just a few veggies so far. Zucchini, squash, and watermelon seem ok here. Carrots love the sandy soil.""
B: ""That's really interesting that all water filled vegetables seem to grow okay there. I would have never expected that. How is the water situation do you have to pay a lot of water in the house?""
A: ""Yes unfortunately water is very expensive here. Fortunately I live alone so it's not too bad. ""
B: ""Does the solar technology help with water?""
A: ""Have you given any more thought to those solar panels? I think it's a great idea even with the rain!""
B: ""Yes, I've checked into them a little bit. I just don't know how practical they will be with all the rain we get. ""
A: ""How much rain do you get really?""
B: ""Well, it depends on the year and the season, obviously, but it averages about 40 inches a year. How about the desert? When it rains is there a flash flood danger?""
A: ""okay but I still think those solar panel will save you a lot.  LOL it's pretty hot here you can't expect much from a dessert. it doesn't rain much so there isn't much of danger right now.""
B: ""Yeah, but it's not just when it rains. It's cloudy quite a bit, too. So on the days when it doesn't rain, sometimes there is a lot of cloud cover. I am thinking of moving to the desert, though. I think solar panels would really be of value there. ""
A: ""I understand. if you move to the dessert you will thank those solar panels everyday. Do you plan on moving ?""
B: ""We're thinking about it. I really like the diversity of the desert. I think I can work from pretty much anywhere. We're not tied down by our jobs. ""
A: ""I guess you will like it there. how's your job now? you were doing some data entry right?""
B: ""The job is the same. It's just data entry, so it's not rocket science or anything! Ha! I'm sure I can find work pretty much anywhere near a big city. How about you? How's work going for you?""

A: ""When is your next road trip?""
B: ""My next road trip is going to be to Florida, so i can visit my family. Do you travel often?""
A: ""That sounds like fun! Where in Florida do they live? I don't travel terribly often, only for an occasional vacation.""
B: ""They actually live in Orlando so im going to be doing the Theme parks which should be a ton of fun. I usually try to take at least two big road trips a year.""
A: ""Wow, that will be a blast! Have you been to the parks before?""
B: ""Yes i have, but it has been a few years. I am really looking forward to doing Universal studios.""

A: ""No not really but it was such a tragedy for the country I feel it is the patriotic thing to do. I read some books on it while working at the store and there are some things that really stick with you after you read some of the stories.  ""
B: ""That is for sure. I think all of us Americans have a connection in some regard. It really shattered us, collectively. Do you like modern art or more of the classics?""
A: ""Oh i stick with the modern stuff. I interpret things I see when I dance. I consider that my art form. ""

A: ""I do that in my spare time it is good excercise""
B: ""It is. I live french fries and burgers so I need to exercise!""
A: ""Lol well that is a good reason""
B: ""Yes, where do you live?""
A: ""I live in the sunny state of florida surrounded by my huge family""
B: ""That is so nice! I just bought a house in tennessee. Do you like florida?""
A: ""Yes I love it my children are always around and my grandchildren are always over visiting""
B: ""That is wonderful. I'm working on being healthier. No soda, just water!""
A: ""Water is all I drink because I had medical issues three years ago""
B: ""Well it is good for you. Do you have any pets?""

B: ""I have! I actually just took my dog on a walk this morning it was a beautiful day. What is your favorite thing to do with your black lab?""
A: ""My grandson has been coming over to teach him how to catch frisbees.  I really enjoy watching him catch them.  I also enjoy going on long walks with him, his name is Chocolate (in Spanish). What is your dog's name?""
B: ""That is so nice that you get to see your grandson more often! chocolate is a great name for a dog. My dogs name is tyson. How many grandchildren and children do you have? It must be nice to see your family expand so much. ""
A: ""Tyson's a nice name.  I have two children and four grandchildren.  It is such a blessing to have them nearby.. I have really enjoyed watching them grow!""
B: ""That is a big happy family! Also it is nice that you have your family living so close. How long have you lived in florida for?""
A: ""I have lived here for 30 years.  How about you? Do you have any children/grandchildren?""
B: ""I have two children ages 1 and 3. Two boys. I live in tennessee and my wife has to deal with a house full of boys haha. I am really enjoying my family at this age. ""
A: ""Oh wow! Yes, those are some pretty rambunctious ages.  I am sure you both have your hands full!  What do you do for a living?""
B: ""Yea we don't always get enough sleep between us but that's the way it goes I guess! I am a mailman and have been for about 3 years. I enjoy my job for the most part it pays the bills and allows my wife to stay home with the kids. How about you, what do you do for work?""
A: ""I am now retired but I used to be a teacher.  I taught mostly elementary school for 25 years. I really enjoyed teaching.  Do you have any hobbies?""
B: ""I really enjoy eating burgers and fries and watching sports when I can get some spare time. I don't mind putting on a few extra pounds for now! I have a lot of respect for teachers now that I am older with kids of my own. Teachers should be paid like doctors in my opinion. Where in florida do you like to walk on your spare time?""
A: ""We have plans for my family to have a beach day this weekend! It will be my dog's first time in the ocean.""
B: ""That sounds really nice. Will your grandson take the frisbee the beach? I wish we lived closer to the beach the closest one is a 4 hour drive away and that is too long for toddlers.""
A: ""My grandchildren aren't coming, unfortunately. It will just be me, my spouse, and my two children. Tennessee is quite far from the beaches in Florida.""
B: ""That's too bad your grandchildren are not going I am sure you will miss them. I am sure having a dog will be like watching a kid will the dog go swimming? Maybe when the kids are older we will go on a vacation to Florida for now we enjoy the parks here.""
A: ""I'm not quite sure if my black lab will go swimming. It would be neat to see him doing the doggy paddle, but yeah, I will have to watch him to make sure he's safe. What do you, your wife, and your kids like to do at the park?""
B: ""It will be fun to see how a dog acts at a beach. You know what is is like to have small kids they are always doing dangerous things so my wife and I have to watch them carefully. They really like to go on the slide right now though we just hope to tire them out enough so they sleep when we get home.""
A: ""I hope they sleep easily too, for your sake. You told me you and your wife haven't been sleeping the best.""
B: ""Yes it is still difficult managing routines my 1 year old only sleeps a few hours a night. It must be really nice to be a grandparent I can't wait until the kids are older.""
A: ""You will love it once you're retired and the kids are out of the house. Now that I'm retired, I'm taking it easy, just enjoying life with my spouse and Chocolate, the dog. How's the Post Office treating you these days?""
B: ""Florida is a good place for retirement. Post office is good I am used to the routine of the job its not to stressful. Its nice when all the dogs wait in the window to greet me but sometimes they can be a little wild. ""
A: ""Ha! That old cliche about the dog chasing or biting the mailman is true, I see! Have you been keeping up with sports in your nights after work?""
B: ""Fortunately I have never had a dog bite me but it is true some dogs really don't like mail. I don't know why you would think they would be excited about packages especially if they are dog treats. I have not been watching to much sports I try to give my wife a break by looking after the kids when I get home and then I am tired.""
A: ""You won't believe this but my dog actually started barking at the mailman after our last conversation! I think he was just excited to see a smiling face though.""
B: ""That’s amazing. I think that’s a really good sign. How did it turn out?""
A: ""We're working on socialization and boundaries, although I think progress is definitely happening. I've been looking forward to the summer, hanging out in a few local parks. Vacation plans in the mix? ""
B: ""Yeah it’s in the plans. I’ve been really busy with my sons right now. Neither are two but both are acting like they are going through their terrible twos.""
A: ""I love watching kids grow and change, sometimes they end up repeating things! I hear you there. Some days, just getting through the day is a big accomplishment!""
B: ""Watch anything interesting in spots lately?""
A: ""I am going to guess ""spots"" is ""sports"" I hope! We have a few seasons starting up, although the roster always seems to be changing. With summer, tennis will be active too. How's your dog doing? ""
B: ""Tyson is doing very well. He is really great with people. He’s a really good spot... sport I mean about going on walks. ""
A: ""Haha, I see what you did there. I'm glad to get exercise with mine, and is a big reason I decided to get a dog too. Mine's getting good at frisbee. ""
B: ""That’s great Tyson isn’t much of a “fetch” dog. You throw something and he looks at you like “you going to get that?”""
A: ""Well, maybe they compensate by being a good lap dog on the couch? Affection is a big reason to get one too. Pros and cons of keeping a pet guest!""
B: ""Yeah we get outside and exercise so I guess games isn’t the most important thing. ""

B: ""Haha yes! I saw it many years ago when it first came out and never finished it. It is super crazy and I can never get over how there is always something going on with that family.""
A: ""That Gallagher family sure is nuts! It's a pretty edgy show with a lot of bad language, sexual situations, and alcohol abuse. Are your kids old enough to watch it?""
B: ""Oh no, and even if they were I would not want them to. It made me even feel some type of way so I could only imagine their little minds trying to figure out what is going on. Do you have any plans this weekend? ""
A: ""How old are they? I bet they think it's super cool that their parent is a doctor! I'll be volunteering at the shelter all day Saturday, and I have a daytime wrestling match on Sunday.""
B: ""2, 10, & 13. They are a good age but still need to be protected from crazy shows like that haha That sounds like a pretty interesting weekend. Maybe we can stop by the shelter.""
A: ""I'd rather see you guys after work. I'd love to watch some Disney movies if you're up for that.""
B: ""I am, and I am sure the kids would love to see you again. Maybe next time we can stop by and help as well. I know the older ones are interested in volunteering. ""
A: ""Your 13 year old kid is old enough to volunteer. We'd love the extra help!""
B: ""I will let her know so she can get ready for that day. Maybe this summer when school is out. Then we can save and all go to Disneyland! ""
A: ""Our shelter just got new animals in. ""
B: ""Oh that is cool, sad, but cool. I wish all animals could have homes. But it is always fun to meet new ones I guess. Tell me about them.""
A: ""We got a tabby named Cabigail, and a litter of whippet puppies. Their eyes are just starting to open. I'm adopting one, his name is Marky Mark, I plan on putting him in races when he's grown. How is your medical practice doing?""
B: ""Same as always. Nobody delivering babies today. It is a nice reprieve. I need a vacation soon, I get tired of always having to catch babies after a few months.""
A: ""They sure do come out slippery! You almost need to put chalk on your hands to get a grip on a newborn. Are you going to take the family to disneyland again?""
B: ""I hope to sometime next year. Right now I am planning to get my surgery done next vacation, and once I am fully healed, I do plan to go back as often as possible. Do you think you will ever go? ""
A: ""Surgery!!!??? Are you ok? I wish I could go to disneyland but I'm not allowed with 300 feet of schools or parks.""
B: ""oh no, nothing serious. I am fine. Wait, what? Amusment parks count?""
A: ""That's the funny thing, I thought they didn't count, but you wouldn't believe the hassle I got when I went to 6 flags over Atlanta. Judge Melchenhough made it very clear that I can't be around any amusement parks or Chuck E Cheese restaurants. Some people just like to make things hard on the little guy..""
B: ""I guess rules are rules. I didn't realize you had such restrictions. Disney land is so fun. You are really missing out""
A: ""I'm used to all the rules now. Have you got your family more involved in volunteering?""
B: ""Not in the last couple of hours no lol. I do try to get them to join and do things, but not every minute. They do some already, but I want them to do more. I am thinking of making them adopt a highway and that would also help my business.""
A: ""I think I'm going to bring Marky Mark the puppy home this weekend!""
B: ""Thats awesome!  What breed is he?""
A: ""I think he is a mixed bred but it looks like a mix of German Shepard and Vizsla. ""
B: ""Sweet!  I wish we could have a puppy but with the children I am worried that it may be too much for them.  But I love dogs!""
A: ""You should go for it! Working at the animal shelter I know there are plenty of dogs that could use a good home. Just got to find the right bred that are good with children. Or are you worried that your kids won't take care of the dog? ""
B: ""im worried the kids wont take to the dog.  Maybe when they are older and are more responsible.""
A: ""That makes sense. It might be a good idea to wait. Feel free to bring your kids into the animal shelter to play with the dogs. You don't have to take one home but you can introduce the kids to the dogs. ""
B: ""THats a good idea, there is a shelter nearby that allows people to play with the dogs so they can get some socialization.""
A: ""Awesome! It'll be good for the kids and for the dogs. Be careful though once you get in there its hard to leave without a dog. What is your favorite bred? ""

A: ""Do you prefer working in construction? How do you feel about someday taking over the family business?""
B: ""I've honestly never done it. I suppose I'm trying to earn my father's love by taking it over.""
A: ""That's tough that your father hasn't been really affectionate towards you. Do you wish you had a more loving relationship with him?""
B: ""Of course. Growing up, he just gave me ""stuff"",""
A: ""Well I wish the best for you. Maybe working part-time doing construction for him would help strengthen your bond. The new job I got is actually doing manual labor working for my friend. It's very physically demanding but I have to pay my bills somehow. ""
B: ""Very true! And at least you know you like your boss!""
A: ""That is a plus, for sure. Friendship is different, though, in a business context. Sometimes it's hard to listen to him bossing me around.""
B: ""I can imagine. At least I'm used to my dad bossing me.""

B: ""Haha, thanks! Free is definitely my favorite ingredient for burgers.  The benefits aren't great, to be honest, but will hold me over until I start working with my dad.  I still have health insurance through my parents for now, so just saving up as much as I can.  Where are you working now?""
A: ""That's good that you still have health insurance from your parents. I'm in the same boat which has really helped me feel less anxious. I'm working for a friend, just doing manual labor. Started it recently but am not sure what I want to do for a career. If only wages were higher, then I could do something I really loved.""
B: ""If money were of absolutely no concern, what do you think you could see yourself being excited to do for work every day?  Maybe landscaping or gardening?  Might be hard to do that year round depending on the weather where you live though.""
A: ""I'd love to actually be a botanist. Studying plants and gardening would have been my passion but college was too much money. My parents didn't have enough money to send me to it. Maybe one day if school becomes free, I'll consider going. What's your dream job?""
B: ""That sounds like a pretty good plan and glad to hear you have something you are so passionate about.  My dream career would probably be working in Counseling so I could help people struggling with relationship problems like I did with my Dad growing up.  ""
A: ""That would be incredible. You should seriously look at pursuing a program on the side. I know that there are a few online schools that aren't too pricey for psychology. Would you want to be a therapist or a psychologist?""
B: ""Whichever one would allow me to buy more Whataburgers..just kidding lol. Probably a psychologist, but I would honestly have to look more into the differences as I haven't given it a whole lot of thought before you asked me.  Thanks for the encouragement!""
A: ""For sure!! seriously let me know if you need help with finding a program. While I am more into manual labor haha I do love challenging my mind!""
B: ""I definitely will do that.  Thanks again for the offer :).  Maybe you should be the Therapist, encouraging me to reach my dreams and all.  I hope you have a great night.  Enjoyed the chat!""
A: ""Have you looked into any psychology courses?""
B: ""Not yet.  Been too busy at the new job. Have you looked into any colleges for botany?""
A: ""I am planning on going to college to study botany , yes. Right now I do a lot of physical blue collar work for money when bills are tight. I have a new job oding manual labor for my friend so it is good that I am working for someone that I am close to and that respects me. ""
B: ""What type of manual labor are you doing?  It is always good to work for someone that respects you.  ""
A: ""I am doing a lot of gardening and planting around multiple local farms, it pays pretty decent actually. I never grew up rich or with old money, so these paychecks are definitely something new!""
B: ""That's awesome.  The gardening will give you a leg up with your botany.  Sort of on the job learning for your college classes when you go.  I always think the best way to learn something is by doing it.""
A: ""Speaking of that, maybe food service will help me get in touch with food too. I love burgers and never even worked a fast food job before. I have some time before the semester starts for college, maybe that will help.""
B: ""It will definitely help with people skills.  LOL.  You will come in contact with various personalities and learn how to deal with each one.  Hunger doesn't always bring out the best in people.  hahaha ""
A: ""Yeah I remember you mentioned you worked at whatsaburger and how you just got a new job, do you think I should apply for them too? Are they good service and establisment?""

B: ""Thank you and I think I will do that. Going to take me awhile to build up to a marathon though. Do you have any tips for me on running? Should I try a 5k first?""
A: ""Take your time. if your not use to running start out walking and each day try to increase your speed.   Stretching before and after is extremely important.  A 5k would be a good start if your use to running.  It will give you a sense of where your at with your abilty.""
B: ""Sounds like a plan. Hopefully when I'm ready to try biking, I can remember how. It's been years since I've been on a bike. Not a whole lot time to run and bike when I'm out sailing my yacht.

A: ""Occasionally, but I've never gone as far as France. Mostly I travel to good swimming or biking spots up and down the coast. Is the Texas gulf coast good for swimming?""
B: ""It's down to personal preference but I think it's a fine place to swim, It's not too harsh. have you ever thought about scuba swimming off a yacht? I'm around so im sure i could figure something out with you.""
A: ""That sounds amazing. Do you do it in the shallows or do you do deep-sea scuba diving? I love to swim so I'd be thrilled to try either.""
B: ""Haha I like to do it in the shallows, I'm far too scared to do deep sea stuff. how do you feel about the deep sea, regardless of wanting to swim there?""
A: ""I feel like it's beautiful and mysterious and thrilling, and yet also like it kind of wants to suck me in and drown me in a terrifying way. Still love the ocean though, you know?""
B: ""Haha good way to put it I suppose yeah. So anyway, is LA the only marathon that you travel for?""
A: ""It's the only one I regularly commit to every year. I do a few other marathons here and there, but the LA one is the only one I've repeated. Have you ever considered training for a marathon?""

A: ""Would you like to go shopping with me this weekend. I found an antique car shop. ""
B: ""I would be more than happy to!  Is there anything specific you are looking for car-wise?""
A: ""Yes, I am looking for old Porsche in the 1960's""
B: ""Oh I love how Porsches look!  I don't know too much about what would make it a good buy or not, but I'd love to look.  How much are you looking to spend?""
A: ""I don't have a lot of money, hopefully around $20,000""
B: ""Well hopefully we will have some good luck!  Say, have you thought about getting a dog?  I know how much you like them.""
A: ""I love dogs. Do you have a dog, if yes, how many""
B: ""Yes, I have a golden retriever named Sally.  She's a total sweetheart.  Would you ever consider getting a dog/""
A: ""Yes, I would like a dog, but I am having a hard time deciding what type of dog to get, can you give me a suggestion""
B: ""Absolutely! Since you enjoy the outdoors, I think you would do best with a more medium or large-sized dog.  Maybe a retriever or a collie.  Boxers are also a lot of fun!""
A: ""Yes, I was thinking about a Boxer, but I don't know much about a Boxer""
B: ""They are amazing dogs!  They are so sweet and cuddly, but they do love getting out and burning off some energy.  When they get excited, they run in circles and chase their tails...it's so cute!""
A: ""I think I found a Porsche I want to buy.""
B: ""That's great! I know you've been wanting one. What year is it?""
A: ""It is a 1965. It is a great blue color. What do you drive?""
B: ""I don't drive anything too fancy, just an old Honda Civic. It hauls around the dog which is all I need. ""
A: ""I respect that. Saving on a car payment is always good. I just love old cars so much. ""
B: ""Besides the Porsche do you have any other favorite old cars? ""
A: ""I love Jaguars and old Italian cars. What is your dream car?""
B: ""I have always dreamed of a Rolls Royce. I've seen them in movies and they just look so comfortable to ride in. ""
A: ""They are dreamy for sure. I can't wait to take it for a nice drive.""
B: ""I love getting outside. Is there a favorite spot you love to drive to? ""
A: ""I live driving to the mountains even though it still scares me a little bit.""
B: ""The mountains are beautiful. Is the road a bit bumpy up there? I imagine that wouldn't be good for a Porsche. ""
A: ""Have you taken your dog out on any scenic drives lately?""
B: ""Yes always, I take sally out on walks every day. I drive her in my old Honda Civic hen I am going somewhere but I really want her to see how a Rolls Royce car feels.""
A: ""Oh I would love to drive a Rolls one day but they are quite expensive. Even the older ones are. I wouldnt mind finding a classic and fixing it up. I wonder how it would do in the mountains. They tend to be large cars and some of those mountain roads are narrow!""
B: ""haha funny you mention that, I find mountains to be beautiful. I know Is aid that last time we talked but I have to put emphasis! Rolls are great but what about that old italian car you were thinking about getting? The retro style is sick man!""
A: ""I found an old Porsche but havent decided if I am going to go that route or keep looking for something more Italian. What do you like more?""
B: ""I definitely like the italian cars better, they give a more mysterious and cynical look to them. Reminds me of the old gangster movies , probably why I think hey look so cool. However, I dont know much about valuing old cars.. so dont ask me lol/""
A: ""I have a good down payment but it is hard to find those old italians around here. Once you find something shipping it can be a nightmare too!""
B: ""You do have around $20,000 to spend on a car haha. Which is massive , especially since I am a teacher you know pay isnt that great haha. Whatever you get make sure to drive it down the mountain! ha""
A: ""Half the fun is just shopping for the perfect car. You can be amazed at some of those old bar finds. You really never know what you are going to come across. I can say though, you teachers are so underpaid! You are helping shape the future of this country and planet by molding the minds of our children. I applaud what you do!""
B: ""I appreciate that, I enjoy being with the kids and being active a lot so it makes up for it . I like walking outdoors with them and the recesses is always really great for teachers aswell. It is always a fun environment !""
A: ""I imagine so. Do you ever get to take Sally with you? I bet the kids would love playing with her!""
B: ""I take sally with me everywhere! We go shopping together too. My kids really love her, you should get that boxer breed you always wanted. I still remember you talking about it from last week!""

B: ""Oh yes! Believe me, i would know nothing about the internet if it were not for my grandson! I usually sit down with a cup of tea and relax next to the grandkids, while they either play on their tablet or teach me how to use it. I definitely did not have anything like it while i was growing up. ""
A: ""I agree. I was lucky if it was my turn in school to even use the computer that day. And living on a farm also limits the amount of internet time I get. The other day we had a storm and I had no internet for weeks. ""
B: ""Wow! That must have been so difficult to handle. I am used to no internet, however, i think my kids and especially my grandkids would go crazy if they didnt have it for even a couple hours.""
A: ""haha I know! Some of us have been so dependent on internet that once everything is gone we do not know what to do with ourselves. Or at times I have heard of people taking it away as a form of punishment. ""
B: ""Yes! That is defintely what my daughter does to my grandkids! They really listen then!""
A: ""So have you read anything interesting lately that you would recommend?""
B: ""I actually just finished reading a book called Killing Caleb it had so many twist and turns in it, was a incredible story to read.""

B: ""A man gets sent to a mental ward and has to prove he isnt crazy.   ""
A: ""That does sound enticing! I haven't read much in the way of literature. How would you suggest I get started?""
B: ""It has a very good story line, i would defiantly recommend it. Honestly i would just start of with a smaller book of the genre you like to read and go from there.""
A: ""What's your absolute favorite genre to read? I feel like you've read just about everything, being a librarian haha!""
B: ""Honestly anything genre as long as it contains some drama, nothing beats a good drama story.""
A: ""I'm guessing you've pushed pretty hard for your grandkids to get into reading?""
B: ""Yes i started reading to them very young, a few of them love to read now so i will take that as a win. ""
A: ""That's wonderful to hear! You must be so proud of them!""
B: ""Yes very proud they are a bunch of great kids. How is living on your farm going?""
A: ""I've been looking for books that take place on a farm, might as well start reading about something I know!""
B: ""Great idea! I love steering people toward books they will enjoy! Have you read any james herriot? He was a vet surgeon and has some very interesting stuff ""
A: ""I don't think I have. But that sounds really interesting. Does he right fiction or non-fiction? What are his books about? ""
B: ""He writes non-fiction. One is ""All Creatures Great and Small"". They are about his life as a veterinary surgeon with all kinds of animals. What do you like most about living on a farm?""
A: ""I'll put that on my books to read. That will be right in my wheel-house. I really enjoy being able to go out a accomplish something everyday and actually see what I have accomplished. I get to work hard and when the job is done relax and enjoy the beautiful country I live in. ""
B: ""That sounds wonderful! I am looking forward to retiring in a few years and enjoying the scenery everywhere I go. It makes me reflect on life and serving the community. You must put a lot of effort into your work.""
A: ""It is tough work but it is rewarding. If you retire in Spain do you think you will live in the country or live somewhere in the city? ""
B: ""I will keep my farmhouse and live there primarily. I would also like a vacation home but don't want to be too far from my grandchildren, so I haven't decided exactly where that will be yet. ""
A: ""Sounds like an ideal retirement! Family is important If I had grandchild I don't think I would want to move away from them either. How far do they live away from you now? ""
B: ""They only live 30 minutes away right now so I get to see them often. I travel to visit them as often as I can. They are the light of my life!""
A: ""I hear being a grandparent takes the best parts of being a parent without the downside is that true? 30 mins isn't too bad at all. ""
B: ""Yes it absolutely does. I was a stressed out mother, but I am a very calm and caring grandmother. I feel like I can correct all my mistakes now!""

A: ""When I'm old enough to shop for myself, I'll.""
B: ""Good. Only buy organic, because its good for you.""
A: ""I will remember that. I should get back to the playground now.""
B: ""Have fun! And stay safe out there.""
A: ""I will. You can come if you want to. I have lots of friends.""
B: ""I will think about it. But I have a feminist march to attend later.""
A: ""Sorry I didn't make it to the playground. How are you friends. I hope you had fun without me.""
B: ""It's okay, I didn't want to go anyways but my other friends forced me. They're doing good, but I wish they understood that I'd rather spend time online than go to the playground.""
A: ""I wish I could spend more time online! I want to go on Twitter but my parents won't let me. You're lucky that you're allowed!""
B: ""I think it's because my mom wants me to learn about a lot of other people and how the world works. It's on Twitter that we found out about the feminist march happening later. You should ask your parents if you can join!""
A: ""Oh that sounds interesting, but I don't think they will let me go. They won't even let me go shopping by myself. ""
B: ""That stinks! I'll have to tell you about it in class on Monday then! Speaking of class, did you finish the homework assignment yet? I really wish we didn't have to write about Disney and Mickey Mouse!""
A: ""I can't wait to hear about it! Yeah I've done the assignment! I love Mickey Mouse so much and I really want to go to Disney World! This assignment has made me want to go even more! Don't you like Disney?""
B: ""No way, Mickey Mouse is boy! Besides, women rule the world, so why waste time writing about some old guy?""
A: ""But Micky Mouse is so cool! I still like him even though I'm a girl. Okay women rule the world but Mickey can join in too! I want to go surfing with him!""
B: ""Well you can go surf with Micky Mouse, and I'll stay on the beach surfing the web. Or maybe I'll go fishing so we can have fresh fish for dinner! Isn't organic food always the yummiest?""
A: ""Alright that's a plan. Eugh, I hate fish and I can't tell whether a food is organic or not. I just want to play with my friends.""
B: ""You can tell food is organic because it tastes fresh and crisp! But if you're not used to it, it can be hard to tell. Maybe at school we can play farmers and grow our own organic food!""
A: ""How was going to the feminist march?""
B: ""It was incredible!!! Such an empowering movement. I'm looking at writing about it for one of feminism in politics classes at school! ""
A: ""Oh, that sounds really interesting.  What did y'all actually do at the march?  I have never really gotten to attend any political rallies or marches.""
B: ""We all brought posters addressing issues with women rights and connected with each other on Twitter! It was great to see and the network is so strong""
A: ""Oh man, that sounds really cool. I love making art and posters.  Walt Disney was my favorite animator of all time and really inspires me with his creativity to bring so many characters to life.  What is Twitter like?  My parents are still being bossy and not letting me join""
B: ""ugh that sucks!! I hope you can join when you turn 18. It's let me learn about so many problematic issues. I'm so thankful I'm on it otherwise I would still be eating fast food all the time!!!""
A: ""Uh oh!  I don't know if I am looking forward to joining as much as I thought I was if it means I have to give up fast food..lol.  What did you see on there that made you give up fast food?""
B: ""SOOO many disgusting things about meat quality haha. I promise it's worth it though! I've felt so much healthier since I stopped eating fast food. Organic food needs to be the default though... I hate how easy it is for large companies to decide everything we do""
A: ""Hmm, interesting!  I still can't really decide what to buy or anything, but my parents never buy organic food and I seem to be doing fine.  I guess you don't really know what you're missing if you've never tried it though.""
B: ""Dang, your parents seem quite controlling haha. What else do they decide for you? Agency is so important.""
A: ""Haha, I know but they do love me and care about me.  Well, like for example, I still have a bedtime, can only have 1 hour of screentime a day, and have to ask permission to sleep over at my friends house.  What does agency mean?""
B: ""Agency is when you're able to make your own decisions or when you can learn how to make your own decisions. That's fairly standard. The 1 hour of screentime a day must be hard. How do you use it?""
A: ""I started a conversation today with my parents about Twitter.  I told them that I understand their concerns but that I want to use Twitter to connect with others and learn.  They said I should be more specific about what issues I want to learn about and what kinds of groups I want to connect with on Twitter and then we can discuss it more.""
B: ""I can see their point, but it wouldn't be difficult for you to come up with something. Lots of cultural groups have Twitter accounts you could follow.""
A: ""Yeah that is true, maybe next time I will write down different types of groups I would like to join and if they see it on paper maybe they will feel different. ""
B: ""You probably like reading or music or something. You could find a literature group or an author that tweets.""
A: ""Yeah that too. I will ask my friends what there parents allow so I myself can get a better idea. Thanks for the insight. ""
B: ""I don't know if you're interested, but there were lots of younger women and girls on the march yesterday. It was great!""
A: ""Maybe I can ask my mom if I can join you at the end of the month for the feminist walk. I think my mom would enjoy doing that too, if that is ok if we tag along. ""
B: ""Yes, that would be great. Do you think she would mind that we met online?""
A: ""I never actually thought about that. Maybe I will leave that part out. She will be with me anyway so shouldn’t be too much of a problem.""
B: ""I would love to meet your mother. I'm sure she's a really great person.""
A: ""Other than her style of parenting she is super kind and very goofy. I’m sure you both will get on great. ""

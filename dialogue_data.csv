"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""Hi! How are you doing tonight?""
B: ""I'm doing great. Just relaxing with my two dogs.""
A: ""Great. In my spare time I do volunteer work.""
B: ""That's neat. What kind of volunteer work do you do?""
A: ""I work in a homeless shelter in my town.""
B: ""Good for you. Do you like vintage cars? I've two older mustangs.""
A: ""Cool. Not really into cars. My day job is wrestling.""
B: ""Cars are my thing. Vintage cars. I love working on them. Wrestling? Do you enjoy it?""
A: ""Yes, I love the crowds, getting to know people.""
B: ""I didn't think about the crowd aspect of wrestling. I do not like crowds.""
A: ""Understood. When I need to be alone, I work out a few times each week.""
B: ""I agree. Working out is a great way to burn off steam. Do you like country music?""
A: ""A little bit. I can get into taylor swift.""
B: ""Lol. She's more pop now. Her old stuff was country. I like classic country.""
A: ""What kind of dogs do you have?""
B: ""One is a terrier and one is a sheep dog.   How long have you been volunteering?""
A: ""I have been volunteering for last 7 years""
B: ""Nice.  I try to, but I've been working on the two Mustangs.  One is a 68 and the other is a 66 Hertz clone.""
A: ""What are doing with those two?""
B: ""The 68 is a daily driver, at least during the summer.  The Hertz clone is a trailer queen.  I'm too afraid of paying for on  the road insurance.   ""
A: ""How long have you been doing this?""
B: ""Ummmm, off and on, since 1989.  It's a hobby that takes a lot of devotion.  It can be expensive, but it doesn't always have to be.""
A: ""This sounds fun. Do you have any other hobby?""
B: ""Well I do like to listen to classic country, and I do have my two dogs, ""Baron Zemo"" and ""Spike.""   What about you, how do you like wrestling as your day job?""
A: ""I'm not super into wrestling. ""
B: ""Ah, now that makes sense.  I guess it's like an engineer that doesn't like to fix stuff around the house.  Well, work is work, I guess.""
A: ""How's work on the Mustang coming?""
B: ""Not so good, I got bit by one of my dogs and needed stiches in my hand so haven't been able to make much progress.""
A: ""I'm so sorry to hear that! How on earth did that happen?""
B: ""Just a little rough housing that went a bit too far.  ""
A: ""That's unfortunate. I'm hoping you'll make a speedy recovery! What's your day job?""
B: ""I'm a dog trainer!  I guess I'm not that good""
A: ""Haha well I suppose no one is perfect. Given my recent string of lost matches, I can't say I'm doing much better.""
B: ""Yeah between the both of us, could probably get a country song written about our distresses...perhaps Taylor Swift could perform it.""
A: ""That would be a chart-topper, I'm sure. Something to blast while driving with the top down, maybe even in your next restoration project.""
B: ""Yes!! Can't wait to get back in the saddle with the restoration.  One of the one's I am working on is a convertible.""
A: ""Sweet! I'm sure that will be an amazing ride once it's finished. How long does a project take to complete, generally speaking?""
B: ""For me, I can usually do a full restoration in 6 months if I put in a few hours a day after work.""
A: ""Did you take your dogs out for a walk today?""
B: ""Yes! Thankfully there was enough of a break in the rain to run them around. How's your day been?""
A: ""It has been busy! I volunteered at the homeless shelter this morning. Do you do any volunteering? ""
B: ""Sadly not. I admire those who do though! Work keeps me so busy, and then I spent time on my car to relax. How did you get into wrestling as a job?""
A: ""I work out a few times a week and a trainer came over and asked if I was interested in wrestling and gave it a go! Have you ever wrestled? ""
B: ""No I haven't, I think I'd be terrible at it! Does it take you a long time to recover? It looks so physical and exhuasting!""
A: ""No different in my opinion then working out at the gym, keeps your mind focused! You should try it sometime, I think you would like wrestling!""
B: ""I can definitely see how it would be cathartic, although I'm so worried about getting my ass whooped I'm sure I'd be terrible. But it's all about working up a sweat, right?""
A: ""Yes, getting beat is not a highlight but makes you want to train even harder! And working up a sweat is no joke! Ha ha. ""
B: ""I definitely respect the mental stamina needed, too. I could learn some more of that, sometimes working on my car gets me so frustrated I can't stand it, ha!""
A: ""I can see that. I have attempted to work on cars, I don't have the patience for it! I need to keep moving!""
B: ""It's definitely an acquired thing. The word needs mechanics and wrestlers, ha!""

"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""Hello, how are you doing?""
B: ""I love spending time with my family""
A: ""That is great, me too! I'm married and my husband and I've 2 children.""
B: ""So then have you ever been to disneyland?""
A: ""No, we recently purchased a new house, so we cannot afford it. Have you?""
B: ""Yes I love mickey mouse such a cute little rat""
A: ""I enjoy going to concerts, I see the rolling stones every year.""
B: ""Man your lucky I am a baby delivery nurse and the pay sucks""
A: ""Maybe you should consider going back to school. I did. I major in economics.""
B: ""I have to walk 3 miles to work to save money everyday what do you do?""
A: ""I mostly eat a fresh and raw diet, so I save on groceries.""
B: ""Your economic skills are amazing""
A: ""Thank you very much! I'm sure you are a great nurse.""
B: ""I'm a ok nurse I have dripped some babies though but I'm getting better""
A: ""I got $50 worth of coupons for fresh fruit and vegetables.""
B: ""That's awesome! How did you manage to score that?""
A: ""I joined a couponing group and won a raffle, it will really help out. How has work been lately?""
B: ""I should do the same! Work is just as bad as ever. I dropped another baby and received a pay penalty because of it. It's going to be a tough month.""
A: ""Oh no! That must be so scary. Can you switch departments?""
B: ""At this point it's not possible without getting an even greater reduction in pay. I'm still toying with the idea of returning to school.""
A: ""That's not a bad idea, maybe go back to school and find your passion. Maybe you could even hit Disney before school started.""
B: ""Haha maybe I should go to school in Orlando. Speaking of school, how is your degree coming along?""
A: ""Good, I was finally able to find a job that valued it. Who knew economics wouldn't be easily employable. What would you go back to school for?""
B: ""Given your experience, possibly economics! Definitely something that doesn't involve hospitals.""
A: ""Haha I can only imagine how bad you need a break from hospitals. If you'd like I can show you how to coupon to help save money when you go back in school""
B: ""I'd really appreciate that! Hopefully I'll qualify for some scholarships, but I'll need to save every dollar I can.""
A: ""What happened at work, were you punished or has it blown over?""
B: ""Yes thankfully its all blown over, wont be doing that again. Hows your job been going?""
A: ""I'm so glad to hear that it all got sorted for you. My job has just been incredible they have welcomed me to their group, feels like I have always worked there. ""
B: ""Thankyou. Oh im so glad to hear that its all going so well for you. You really have worked so hard to get to where you are. I bet your wife and kids are so proud of you!""
A: ""Yes they are just happy that I'm now happy in a job doing what I love to do. I know previously you have said you want to learn how to save using coupons my wife would be more and happy to give you some tips if you like. ""
B: ""Thats so good to hear. Omg that would be so amazing of her to do that for me i will message her in the week to see when she is free, thankyou so much. How are the kids doing?""
A: ""No worries at all she would love to be able to get with someone to do that. And my kids are doing amazing they are adjusting to the new house now and love it. They have made so many new friends and love their new school, so really is the best decision we made to move here. ""
B: ""That is great to hear that they are settling in well. I know some kids have a hard time adjusting but your kids are just amazing. How are you finding the new area you live in?""
A: ""It is honestly beautiful, our new neighbours have been so welcoming and we are actually have a get together this weekend you should come over too if your not busy!""
B: ""That so awesome to hear you all loving your new area you live in. That would be great i will message you later on in the week to see if i am able to make it, thanks. ""
A: ""Your more than welcome. It has been a while since we have seen you and I know the kids will be so happy maybe we will make it a surprise for them if you can come. ""
B: ""Oh yeah that would be good, i sure have missed those kids of yours.  Have you been to any new concerts lately?""
A: ""Have things improved at work?""
B: ""Not really, the job is really demanding and doesn't pay very well.  I would like to go back to school if I could afford it.""
A: ""What would you want to study if you went back to school?""
B: ""I am really interested in business and the economy, so I was thinking economics.  Definitely nothing related to medicine!""
A: ""That is quite a change but if you are not happy doing what you are doing then go for it. I can tell you that doing a job in an area you enjoy is worth the hassle of retraining. ""
B: ""I agree and hope I can follow through.  I was wondering how your move into your new home was going?""
A: ""It went well. I haven't got much inside yet as I don't have much money. However, I have big plans for the future for the space.""
B: ""Sounds great!  Does the  house need a lot of work?""
A: ""No not at all but I want to furnish it properly. It is just empty space at the moment. ""
B: ""Well, hopefully you'll make lots of money at your new job and you'll get all the furniture you want!""
A: ""I'm hoping so. I'll still have no money though as I will be spending it all on the new house!""
B: ""At least those are worthwile expenses.  Your an economist, so I trust you'll figure out the best way to spend your money.""

"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""Hello what are doing today?""
B: ""I am good, I just got off work and tired, I have two jobs.""
A: ""I just got done watching a horror movie""
B: ""I rather read, I've read about 20 books this year.""
A: ""Wow! I do love a good horror movie. Loving this cooler weather""
B: ""But a good movie is always good.""
A: ""Yes! My son is in junior high and I just started letting him watch them too""
B: ""I work in the movies as well.""
A: ""Neat!! I used to work in the human services field""
B: ""Yes it is neat, I stunt double, it is so much fun and hard work.""
A: ""Yes I bet you can get hurt. My wife works and I stay at home""
B: ""Nice, I only have one parent so now I help out my mom.""
A: ""I bet she appreciates that very much.""
B: ""She raised me right, I am just like her.""
A: ""My dad was always busy working at home depot""
B: ""Now that I am older home depot is my toy r us.""
A: ""I've heard they're making a new Stephen King adaptation - I bet I end up going to see it!""
B: ""Yeah, I am trying to get in on that one! I want to be in one of his movies because they are bomb!""
A: ""So cool. Where I live they filmed the Shawshank Redemption.  I know some people who were doubles in it. I love horror but true crime is my favorite thing to read. What kind of books have you read so far this year? Any you recommend? ""
B: ""Oh yeah. I read this one book called The Butterfly Garden by Dot Huchinson. It was very dark and disturbing, but it was true crime/fiction. And it is still haunting me. It is a book in her collectors series. I have not yet been able to get myself to read the others in that series because it hit me pretty hard.""
A: ""Wow. That sounds like something I would really love. I just finished a book myself this morning about a serial killer. Do you read your books through Kindle? Or check them out from the library? ""
B: ""I have kindle unlimited and the libby app, but I believe that particular one was on Kindle Unlimited. It was about teenaged girls being kidnapped and locked in a giant jar and turned into butterflies permanently after the man and his son had their way with them. So I had to lay off her books for a bit. Oh! I also read Billy Straight. that was on libby from my library. It is AMAZING. and it is a true crime story! What was the book you read?""
A: ""I have never heard of the Libby app. I'll have to check that out. I use Kindle because I have Amazon Prime and there are a ton of free books to find that way. The book I read was called Fatal Charm. It was about a husband who murdered two of his wives staging it to look like accidents each time. I hope to find another similar one to read next. What was Billy Straight about?""
B: ""Billy Straight is about a runaway kid that goes to hollywood and pretends to be in school but lives in a park. He witnesses a high profile murder and the cops are searching for him, thinking it was like an old bag lady, but confused as to why the possible witness had a presidents book wrapped in plastic out there. I have Amazon Prime as well. The first book I mentioned may be available on Prime reading. The libby app is an app where you can use your local library card to borrow books virtually and read them on your kindle.""
A: ""Oh ok. I have used other type of apps where it syncs up with the library number to check books out. I really love that option when checking out books now. Makes it so easy and convenient! ""
B: ""Yeah it does! I am so happy to have someone to talk about books with! Not many people that I know appreciate them as much as they should. Plus everyone always wants to know what cool stunts I have been a part of, they forget that my favorite hobby  is reading everything ever written haha. ""
A: ""You never know, with everything you have done in your past, I might read a book about YOU eventually! I can't even imagine what interesting stuff you'd be able to put in a book like that. My life is pretty monotonous so there wouldn't be much to put in a book about me. ""
B: ""I mean, you said you like Stephen King. And Shawshank. I read that book. It was pretty boring. But it was also amazing. You never know what someone else might like to read. Also, doing stunts isn't always fun or exciting. Sometimes it is just falling off a roof and having to lay up for 7 weeks over a broken ankle. Nobody wants to hear about binge reading all of Jeff Wheelers books!""
A: ""What other books have you read in your life that really stand out to you?""
B: ""Dr Seuss' Old Hat New Hat has always resonated with me.  Are you familiar with it? ""
A: ""Haha I think I may have read it years ago as a kid. Remind me what it's about?""
B: ""A character is shopping for hats and trying all types of hats on and none are suitable until he finds his old hat which he had taken off when he entered the hat store.  Not an actual classic, but lots of fun.""
A: ""Well my son is probably too old for it at this point, but I might volunteer to read it for the kids group at the library!""
B: ""I often take it out when I am having a rough day at work...it is mindless fun.  Almost as much as the stunt double work I just did.""
A: ""That sounds like an incredible amount of fun, but anything but mindless! What was your last stunt gig?""
B: ""I stood in for the actor who is playing Rocky Balboa in a remake of the original Rocky movie.  ""
A: ""Wow, I'm super impressed! Tell me, what sorts of stunts do you have to do for this one? My imagination is running wild.""
B: ""Just imagine getting punched over and over again!""
A: ""Oof, talk about working hard for the money! Hopefully you're getting free visits to a massage therapist as part of the package!""
B: ""Only the real stars get that treatment.  The stunt doubles get old coffee and donuts in the trailer.""
A: ""Do you have any new stunt double jobs coming  up?""
B: ""No, I don't have any at this time.""
A: ""You must have a lot of free time to read then.  Are you reading anything good now?""
B: ""I am reading The Butterfly Garden book, and it is good.  How was Fatal Charm?""
A: ""It was very good, I love true crime books!  I'm definitely on the look out for something similar.  I spend a lot of time in the library, so I'll find something.""
B: ""I also love True Crime!  Do you watch movies about True Crime as well?""
A: ""Of course, I'll watch or read anything true crime related.  My kindle is just filled with crime books.  What was your experience with The Butterfly Garden?""
B: ""It was so creepy it still enters my dreams.  I see you like Steven King movies, but what about his books?""
A: ""I love the books more!  I'll never watch a Steven King movie until I've read the book.  I think the IT movies may have ruined clowns for me forever.""
B: ""I did not see IT, but heard it was scary!""
A: ""Shawshank is actually one of my favorite movies and I thought the book was good as well.  I'm surprised you found it boring.""
B: ""I still thought it was amazing, but it wasn't my style of book""

"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""How are you? I'm tired of my parents bothering me, hoping to move out soon.""
B: ""I completely get it. My mom is way too traditional for me!""
A: ""I never drink or use drugs. I am 19 and just want to see my friends.""
B: ""I understand. When do you think you might be able to move?""
A: ""Not sure. I have a part time job at burger king. Do you work?""
B: ""I do. I coach swimming at the pool near my house.""
A: ""Awesome. My parents are just always on me about something. Are you moving soon?""
B: ""I'm still in school. I cannot move until I finish my degree""
A: ""That must be tough. What do you study?""
B: ""I want to be a computer programmer. Are you in school?""
A: ""Yes, I am studying education and working part time.""
B: ""That sounds interesting. Do you like it?""
A: ""Yes, I love it. How are your courses?""
B: ""They are great. I really like the challenge. What do you want to teach?""
A: ""I hope to teach elementary school. How much longer until you graduate?""
B: ""Three more years. I feel like I wil never get out. How about you?""
A: ""Same for me! Looking forward to being done and out of my parents house!""
B: ""Things are so strict. My family is from india, so they just don't get it.""
A: ""Does your college have a dorm? Mine just called, I forgot I was even on the waiting list, and I get to move out! Check into it okay?""
B: ""Oh wow, that sounds great! I'm envious that you're able to move out. I can't move out. My college has a dorm but I'm not able to move out for now. Do you think you'll be able to concentrate on your studies while living in a dorm?""
A: ""I have always loved to study, so that should not be a problem. I don't like to party, I do want to hang out and maybe have a few video game or movie nights""
B: ""Maybe I can come visit you in your dorm room so I feel more like I'm in college and not living with my parents. Do you think you'll try to form a study group?""
A: ""Oh yes. I am all about meeting to study together. I have not had one in a year or two, but we used to do like every week a different person would get their parents to buy lunch or dinner, depending on when the meeting was. Like now, I guess that it would have to be one of us haha. But we would have like pizza and pop or burgers and fries. One girl always brought edible arrangement fruit bouquets and those were amazing! We all loved her day. They came with like caramel and yogurt fruit dip! Would you consider joining a group like that? ""
B: ""Oh yes, that would be great! I'd love to join a group like that. I feel like that would really make me feel like I'm part of a group and not just going to class every day and going back to my parent's hosue. ""
A: ""We can even have slumber parties to watch a movie after if the dorm allows sleeping over. Idk, I have to find out. But like a once a week slumber party with food and a movie would be amazing! And I have access to HBO Max, so we can watch a newly released movie without having to pay for it like once or twice a month!""
B: ""Oh wow!  That's great! That sounds like a ton of fun. Studying turned into fun, who would've thought! I'm sure the dorm room would allow I would think.""
A: ""I hope so! Now I am more excited! We have to decide what subjects we can study together and which ones we will have to like just help out with. Like if you are taking algebra, then I can help, but I am taking a higher math. But if we are both taking BIO, we can study that together!""
B: ""That sounds good, I'm definitely taking BIO right now. It's honestly kind of a waste of time though because it's not my major but pre-requisites suck. I wish they weren't a thing at all. Seems like a waste of money.""
A: ""Yeah. I am working on getting my childhood education degree concentration in my favorite subject, math. But I have to take English and Bio and Art. I won't be teaching any of that so IDK why they are forcing me to take them. But I like to learn so. Oh well I guess.""
B: ""I know, don't you hate that? But like you said, I like to learn too! Just lots of money. ""
A: ""I decided I could probably use some study help with bio after all""
B: ""So will you get a study group started to help with that?""
A: ""Yes I'm taking to a couple of my classmates to see if they can help me set one up. ""
B: ""That sounds like a good idea. I don't like bio much, so I would definitely join a study group to help!""
A: ""Well once I have one together I will let you know so you can join also. How's the rest of your classes going? ""
B: ""That would be great, thanks! The rest of my classes are going well. I still enjoy them, but I don't have much time to socialize.""
A: ""Yes I am in the same situation. Studying is taking up so much of my time but I trying to come out with the perfect Gpa score so that's what it takes. ""
B: ""That is a great goal! My traditional parents would be very happy if I had a perfect GPA as well. I am hoping to get as close as I can. I would love to visit the dorms sometime. ""
A: ""I'm sure you will get it. You are also studying very hard I'm sure you parents are so proud of you. You should defiantly come visit and I will show you around. ""
B: ""Thanks, that's nice of you to say, and it would be great to have someone to show me around! The campus seems so large, I would probably get lost easily. How is your part time job going?""
A: ""Yes it very large but you soon get used to getting around. And it's going well but I wish I had more time in my days to get everything I need done. But I do like having a little break from school work. ""
B: ""Do you enjoy working at Burger King? Does it pay well?""
A: ""I got called in for a shift at work.""
B: ""I hear you, that sounds rough. Hope you had enough rest. Are you going in, or turning down the offer? ""
A: ""I'm going in, I could use the extra hours.""
B: ""Money is a good thing, even if you have to give up time to get it. I've got a bunch of reading to do this week, for school. ""
A: ""Is there any particular study you'll be doing the reading for?""
B: ""I'm studying a computer coding language. Very repetitive. How about your studies? ""
A: ""I'm done with my studies. What made you pic computer coding as a subject of study?""
B: ""Well that was quick, and so much detail there! heheh. Coding is something my mind does very well, and it just makes sense to me, to work through. No studies, and just moved to the dorms. What's that like? ""
A: ""It's good. I've been enjoying my free time now and can partake in more of my hobbies. How long have you been coding for?""
B: ""A few years now, although I guess it takes a few years to good, just like your hobbies. Tell me one specific hobby you have!""
A: ""I've just been binging a lot of hbo lately. Mostly catching up on old tv shows. Do you have hbo max?""
B: ""I'm not sure, would have to check with my parents on that. Lately, haven't been hunting for things to watch. Sounds like you may have a hobby as a movie critic some day. ""

"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""Hi, how are you doing today?""
B: ""Good! You! Celebrating with fellow centenarians""
A: ""Nice. I'm playing some card games with my family.""
B: ""That sounds like fun. I like wine and dancing too!""
A: ""Same. I try to get a small workout in a three mile walk for me is key.""
B: ""Awesome! Walking like that you might live forever like me!!""
A: ""That's true. My favorite way to unwind is reading a book.""
B: ""You sound very like minded, just add some wine""
A: ""Which do you prefer white or red?""
B: ""Fermented. I prefer well aged and fermented. I could bathe in it!""
A: ""Good choice. I always like a nice dry white wine.""
B: ""I think I should go grab a bottle now and get some dancing music on""
A: ""Sounds like a good way to enjoy a sunday afternoon.""
B: ""Yes indeed. Being a centenarian you learn to appreciate these things""
A: ""Since you've reached such an old age, do you have any advice for how to stay healthy and live long?""
B: ""I think it is luck I drink wine. I don't watch what I eat. I just try and enjoy life especially at my age.""
A: ""Haha well they say that wine keeps you young, so maybe there's something to it. Have you tried any great wines lately?""
B: ""I tried a Malbec just yesterday that was wonderful. I drank the whole bottle haha. what about you?""
A: ""I tried a Rhone wine yesterday, and it was fire! I'm amazed you could finish an entire bottle!""
B: ""Oh a bottle isn't that much. Remember I'm 100. I don't work. I have wine with my lunch and if it is a good bottle, that is my beverage for the day.""
A: ""That's a good approach! Sounds like a great way to economize, too!""
B: ""That's right. How  is your family? how many of you are there?""
A: ""There are four of us! I have an older brother and my two parents. Us men like to enjoy a cigar together in the evenings.""
B: ""I have had some cigars I like, but never got into it. Maybe that has helped me live a long time.""
A: ""That's definitely true. Though since you've already made it this long, I doubt smoking a few cigars here and there would hurt!""
B: ""Even if it does, I have lived a good life. I just want to enjoy all the time I have left whether that is a week a year or even another decade.""
A: ""There's a new wine subscription service that let you try different wines on a monthly basis. I am thinking about trying it. How about you?""
B: ""Yes same here. Sometimes even if you pay high price, still the flavor is not that smooth. Don't you agree?""
A: ""I am not sure how much choice you get. Is your service very expensive?""
B: ""Yes a little bit expensive. Can you recommend any new good wine with affordable price as well as quality is nice?""
A: ""I really prefer sangrias, although some find them a bit too sweet. Do you like sweet wines?""
B: ""Yes, but not that much sweet. I will try your wine label next time. I hope it will taste nice.""
A: ""it is. Do you then prefer dry wines? red or white?""
B: ""I absolutely love red wine. I think you like the white one?""
A: ""whites I love, like a good schwartzkatz...german wines You more french or german?""
B: ""I heard a lot of good things about German wines. I always prefer French wine though.""
A: ""what is your favorite french wine?""
B: ""Bordeaux red is my favorite one. Have you tried it?""
A: ""What do you attribute your longevity to?""
B: ""Well, I think it has to do in part with not smoking. Also, I think the red wine has provided me with lasting health benefits.""
A: ""Doctors do say that red wine is great for health. Wish I could get into red wine more, I do prefer the white. Had a great gewurztraminer this month. ""
B: ""What in tarnation is a gewurztraminer? I've never heard of that wine.""
A: ""It's a German white wine, you say you prefer French reds. Wonder if you'll ever get curious and try more German white wines! ""
B: ""Hey, if it's got booze in it, I'm willing to give it a whirl! Can I buy gewurztraminer wine anywhere?""
A: ""I've seen it in a handful of stores, and I'm not in the largest city, so yes. It's usually on the menu at my favorite high end restaurant in town. It's not the most expensive, but has a nice bright sweetness. What's the last red wine you've had?  ""
B: ""I'll look for it the next time I visit my favorite wine shops. You might laugh, but the last wine I had was Yago! Sangria. I was at a friend's house and that's all they had. It's not quite up to my snobbish, elitist standards, to say the least.""
A: ""Ah, variety is the spice of life, they say. Sangria can pack a bit to it sometimes.  I hope it was a good one. The last red I really enjoyed, was a tawny port wine. ""
B: ""Port is nice, too. It's quite heady and strong. So, what else have you been up to besides guzzling vino and smoking stogies? Ha!""
A: ""Oh, been chatting with a few friends with wild senses of humor. That may be you, hehe. Lining up my week, considering when exercise will happen. You? ""

B: ""Oh wow, I can imagine it was a very hard time""
A: ""It was, but it made us strong.""
B: ""Yes it really did, that's why I enjoy y volunteer work""
A: ""You have inspired me I signed up with a local soup kitchen to help during the holidays, maybe it will help with my seasonal depression.""
B: ""I think that this will actually be great for you! How do you feel now?""
A: ""I am feeling hopeful. Since I grew up poor, I know how it feels to be helped when you need it and I'm happy to do that for someone else.""
B: ""Yes, that is why the soup kitchen idea is such a joy!""
A: ""What inspired you to dye your hair purple?""
B: ""I just wanted something different at the moment! Would you ever consider dying your hair?""
A: ""I don't think so, I'm way too old for that. I don't have much hair anymore!""
B: ""Well, I think you could still do something cool perhaps! Any ideas?""
A: ""I would like to change my wardrobe. I haven't bought new clothes in about 15 years. ""
B: ""Wow, that would be so fun! Maybe you could try a store like Macy's!""
A: ""I like Macy's. I used to shop there. Shopping is very hard for someone my age, though.""
B: ""Right, I could just imagine. Perhaps hiring a shopper would be better then?""
A: ""I've been thinking about the soup kitchen and might want to invite you at the same time you are.""
B: ""Oh yes that would be great. I normally go down on friday's and sunday's if any of those days work for you?""
A: ""Those days do indeed work for me. How long are the shifts, and what time of day do they take place?""
B: ""Ok perfect sound like a plan then. The shifts are usually about 4 hours and they start at around 10am. Would you like to check out Macy's once we are done?""
A: ""We could certainly do that if the store isn't too far from the soup kitchen. I'd appreciate your input regarding fashion.""
B: ""Yes its not to far and i will drive us and take you home after. Yes i can defiantly help, i love to shop for new clothes so will probably get my some new stuff too. ""
A: ""That's very kind of you. What sort of budget do you suggest I have for this shopping trip?""
B: ""Your welcome. I would say around $50 you could probably get atleast two whole new outfits with that. Macy's usually have some amazing deals. ""
A: ""That's not bad! I was expecting much worse, but with my memory being so bad, I can't even remember what I spent last time I shopped for clothes!""
B: ""Yeah Macy's sure is the place to shop. I know you said you dont like the holidays but if you like you can spend Thanksgiving with my family this year if you like? ""
A: ""That's very sweet of you to offer. I think I'll be free then. Will your family be coming into town, or would I need to plan to travel?""
B: ""Your welcome. And my family is coming to my house this year so you don't have to travel too far. ""
A: ""I love my new outfits will you help me shop again?""
B: ""Absolutely! I'm itching to go shopping, especially with summer coming up. We can hit Macy's, Lord & Taylor, and Nordstrom Rack.""
A: ""Ooh, those sound like a good idea. Might also hit up Dillards and J.C. Penny. Actually, are those still around? I thought J.C. Penny went bankrupt a while back.""
B: ""We can hit those stores, too. I'd like to go to Hot Topic, also, as they have cool garb that would go well with my purple hair. J.C. Penney did file bankruptcy in 2020, and they closed many stores, but they are still operating.""
A: ""Oh, it's good to know they're still around. They've always got a bunch of good clearance deals. Hot Topic sounds like a must-visit as well. I've never shopped there before. What sets it apart?""
B: ""I'm all about the clearance deals! I think I've got a keen eye for bargains because my family didn't have much money while I was growing up. Hot Topic has a lot of rock band merchandise, gothic wear, punk rock wear, music, accessories, and more.""
A: ""I grew up poor as well. Well, actually, basically everyone was poor during the depression. Ooh, Hot Topic sounds great, especially for younger folks. I'm not sure it'd fit my old geezer style, though. I'd be happy to check it out, however.""
B: ""I can't imagine how tough it was to go through the Great Depression. I'm glad you decided to volunteer for the soup kitchen, though. You're going to feel so good about yourself helping needy folks during the holidays.""
A: ""Yeah, it helps keep my spirits up. The holidays are cold, plus everyone I love is dead and I'm without anyone to celebrate with, so I'm pretty miserable during the holidays. Volunteering keeps me occupied.""
B: ""I'm sorry to hear you have a rough time during the holidays. Have you ever done any volunteer work before?""
A: ""I have. I used to volunteer at an animal shelter, but that requires me to chase animals around, and I'm too old for that kind of stuff now. Ladling soup and greeting people sounds like a more doable task for me. ""
B: ""I've never volunteered at an animal shelter, before, but it's something to consider. I'm an animal lover, as well.""

A: ""Hello, how are you doing?""
B: ""Hello. Pretty good, thanks. And yourself?""
A: ""Awesome, I just got back from a bike ride.""
B: ""Cool! Do you spend a lot of time biking?""
A: ""Yup. Its my favorite thing to do. Do you?""
B: ""I love playing folk music. I actually hope to be a professional musician someday""
A: ""That's interesting. What instruments do you play?""
B: ""I can play the guitar and the piano and I also like to sing.""
A: ""I can only sing when I drink, but I don't like to do that anymore.""
B: ""I m not a big drinker either. Do you have a job?""
A: ""Construction, like my dad. What do you do when you aren't being a rock star""
B: ""Nice! I work as a custodian. Not too glamorous but it pays the bills haha""
A: ""I feel ya. You gotta do what you gotta do.""
B: ""Exactly. Do you have other hobbies besides biking?""
A: ""Today's weather was beautiful for biking.  It was the first thing I did after my long day working my construction job.  Did you get to play any guitar or piano today?  Or perhaps a drink at a local bar?""
B: ""I did fiddle around with my guitar a little.  I played some Bob Dylan after I ate.""
A: ""Nice. Is Dylan a favorite of yours? I haven't been much into music in a long time but sometimes I wish I listened to more.""
B: ""Yes, I've always loved Dylan.  I think he's such a musical genius. He's not the only reason I want to get into music, but he's one of them.""
A: ""Since you're so interested in music, do you ever get out to see local bands? I used to go to concerts every few months when I was younger.""
B: ""Yes, I try to stay connected to the local music scene, and also try to see bigger acts when they come to town, although money and time are always consideration too.  What was the last concert you went to?""
A: ""Yeah, it's definitely hard to find time nowadays. I think the last concert I went to see might have been a pair of cellists with some friends. I think they were called 2Cellos but I could be mistaken.""
B: ""Oh, nice.  Have you heard of Mark O'Connor?  I once saw him in concert with Yo-Yo Ma.  That was amazing.""
A: ""Yeah, I think I ran across some of his performances on YouTube at some point. I could listen to violin and cello music all the time if I had the opportunity. I like to put on videos in the background to provide some background noise. And an occasional distraction.""
B: ""Yes, I love listening to classic or baroque if I'm doing something that needs concentration.  Do you listen to music when you ride your bike?""
A: ""I should. Usually I'm listening to podcasts when I'm riding my bike. Since I don't have much time I try to keep abreast of current events that way.""
B: ""Yes, that's a good time to kill two birds with one stone.  I've never really gotten into podcasts.  What type of podcast topics do you listen to?""
A: ""I watched a really cool Youtube video about how Cellos are made. ""
B: ""Cool any process of making an instrument is beautiful to me. Did you search it up or was it a recommend youtube video?""
A: ""It was recommended to me.  You know how those algorithms sometimes seem to read your mind.  But I saw the thumbnail and started watching and got hooked.""
B: ""Those thumbnails really get you to watch just about anything. Whats your favorite podcast to listen to?""
A: ""I tend to bounce around.  I think I get hooked by the personalities and then sort of get tired of them.  But right now I'm listening to one that talks about unsolved crimes.""
B: ""Very cool, my dad listened to a podcast about the zodiac killer a while back, its an interesting story. Where do you usually ride your bike?""
A: ""I mostly ride on streets, albeit pretty quiet streets.  But sometimes I'll take my bike and go on trails or off road.  It take a little longer to do those types of rides, though, so I do them less frequently.""
B: ""A nice bike ride feels great especially in perfect climate. Whats your favorite drink?""
A: ""Well, I used to like a nice rum and Coke back when I was drinking more.  But now I love a lemonade as a treat on a hot summer day, and coconut water most other days.  How about you?""
B: ""I don't tend to drink that much but when i do i like to sip on some Kentucky Bourbon. Blanton is my favorite. Do you have your own construction company or do you work for somebody? ""
A: ""I work for someone.  I got the job through my dad.  They company and owner have been good to my family so I'm happy to work for him.""
B: ""Thats great to hear, connections go a long way.""
A: ""I've just watched another really interesting video about how guitars are made.""
B: ""That sounds so cool! What is the most interesting fact that you learned?""
A: ""I didn't know guitar strings were mostly made of steel and nickel.  ""
B: ""That is really interesting, are violin and cello strings also made of steel and nickel, I wonder?""
A: ""Good question, not sure of cello, but violin strings are made of different material depending on the chord.  Could be nylon, steel or even sheep intestine!""
B: ""Sheep intestine! I have never heard of that. Has it inspired you to listen to more music?""
A: ""No, actually, it has inspired me to drink more Bourbon and to find out how it's made!""
B: ""That is a great idea! I sure do love my bourbon, but I have no idea how it is made. You have a curious mind! What is your favorite subject to read or study up on ?""
A: ""I am fascinated by forensics related to unsolved crimes.  ""
B: ""That sounds extremely fascinating. Have you ever watched the series ""Mindhunter""? Not unsolved crimes, but getting into the minds of serial killers. Pretty cool.""
A: ""No, never saw it, but I will look into it...is it available on Netflix?  ""
B: ""Yes, it is on Netflix! It is based on the true story of when the FBI first started ""profiling"" serial killers. It is what the show Criminal Minds is based on, if you have ever watched that.""

A: ""Have you taken your mum for a Mexican meal yet? Was my arroz con pollos a hit?""

A: ""I haven't really decided yet. Maybe I'll just backpack across the US. I haven't been to the west coast much, and the pacific northwest looks very peaceful and scenic. Maybe I can check that area of the country out.""

B: ""Yes, I do find that things seem to break more readily nowadays.  It's a disposable world.  What do you do most in your new couch?  Watch TV, read, take a nap?""
A: ""To be honest, My kids use it more than I do. But, when I do find time to relax, I like to read. The TV is usually occupied by my 9 year old.""
B: ""Yes, young ones do usually monopolize the screens.  What does your nine-year-old like to watch, not that I'd know any of the shows these days.""
A: ""Since my family has had some time to enjoy the new couch, would you be interested in coming over to try it out?""
B: ""I would love to come try it out and see what the big deal about deep seat couches is all about!""
A: ""You're welcome to come by anytime, but be warned that you'll have to compete for couch space with my two kids, especially my little girl, who is perpetually glued to the boob tube.""
B: ""I'm sure they will let an old lady like me have a seat at the new couch!""
A: ""I'll tell them to play nicely with you. How did your new couch come out when you had it upholstered?""
B: ""Oh you know me! I can't tell the difference and a couch is a couch! Maybe trying out your couch will enlighten me to the world of couches!""
A: ""Ha! How's your job at the library going? Anything fun, exciting, or noteworthy?""
B: ""Working at the library is always a good time for me - familiar, friendly faces and a ton of knowledge for everyone! You should come visit at the library with your kids more.""
A: ""We will! My high-school aged kid has an English term paper due in a few weeks, so I'll have him drive over there to do some research. ""
B: ""I look forward to seeing him. I'll do my best with helping him on his paper! Helping students is one of my favorites as a librarian. ""
A: ""I appreciate that. Maybe you could ask him to help you learn to use Facebook. I bet your kids would get a kick out of their old mother messaging them on Facebook!""

B: ""No, not at all. I thought you were in the Army?""
A: ""Yes I am, I am still a part of the Canadian Army. My contract lasts for about two years from now. I dropped out of college for it, but I might be interested in going back after my contract expires. Are you planning on continuing your education after college?""
B: ""No, I am done with school. I plan on starting a small business. Have you ever owned a business?""
A: ""No I have not, seems like a challenge to me. What kind of business are you interested in starting?""
B: ""I want to own my own bookstore.""
A: ""That sounds cool, I'm sure it will work out well for you given your experience in working in a bookstore. Are you considering in specializing in a specific genre to sell?""
B: ""No, not really. I intend to have a vast sellection. What do you do for fun?""
A: ""I just saw a chemistry book in a bookstore window!""
B: ""I am not a big book fan -- I like audio books instead! do you enjoy using your chemistry lab?""
A: ""Yes, I love to do little experiments with it!  I don't really enjoy reading either, but I was kind of intrigued by the chemistry book haha!""
B: ""totally! it's helpful to have a guide for that kind of hobby.  wish I had the space for it! do you have to live on base for the army?""
A: ""No, I'm in an apartment just off the base, so I had a bit of space for my hobbies.  Do you have a plan to get to your goal of owning a bookstore?  I imagine it's a complicated process to own your own business!""
B: ""that's my hope -- trying to find space to rent is so hard though! I can't decide on what a good location is. think I should aim for a downtown area or a suburb?""
A: ""There are certainly benefits with either choice of location.  Is the bookstore you currently work in located right in the city?  I bet that's a very expensive location.""
B: ""yes it is. the foot traffic is good for business though. I worry if I move away from here I won't have that. do you know what you'd wanna major in if you went back to school?""
A: ""I'm not 100% sure yet but I'm thinking that I'll go into something related to chemistry since I have an interest in that.  Maybe forensic science!""
B: ""that would be really cool. with your military experience that would set you up for many good law enforcement type jobs""
A: ""Exactly!  But first I have to finish my commitment to the Army.  Did you ever consider a military career?""
B: ""I did, but I ended up wanting to go to school or do other things -- it seemed like such a big commitment""
A: ""Hey I know some people and I may know a good affordable place you could rent for your business.""
B: ""Really? That would be fantastic! I would love to get in contact with them. Do you know what area it is in?""
A: ""It is is in Brooklyn and I am sure it would be perfect for your bookstore. ""
B: ""That's great to hear! If this works out, you'll have to come visit when you are out of the Army, even if you don't like books much. Have you considered any school programs for when you are done?""
A: ""Thanks, yes I will. I have been considering forensic science but not sure what the job market is like in that area.""
B: ""That makes sense. Hopefully you can find someone in the industry that might have some insight. Do you think you would stay around Vancouver, either for school or after?""
A: ""I think I might travel somewhere else to look for work. I am used to constantly travelling being in the army so tat does not bother me. I suppose crime will always happen so there is demand for the work. ""
B: ""That's a good point! It seems like it could be a good mix of mystery and hard science if you choose to pursue it. I know reading isn't your favorite, but maybe finding a good Sherlock Holmes or other crime-solving novel could spark your interest!""
A: ""Maybe I could come by your bookstore and pick up a few crime book to get me started. Never enjoy reading but that might be because I haven't found the right ones.""
B: ""I would love to help you find some great books to get you started. If you're like me, you might prefer audio books that you can listen to while you travel.""
A: ""That's a good idea. I think some of the reason I do not like reading is the actual reading. Listening to some audio books could make it more enjoyable for me, thanks for the suggestion!""

B: ""No, but I've heard about it. It's those little things that look almost like a snail shell, right? And it's like potato, but... not? Lol.""
A: ""Exactly, the sauce I put on those things is just amazing. I will also have to make you my wagon wheel pasta but, it is extremely time consuming to make so, I will need advance notice before you come over and eat those.""

A: ""An early harvest then, although new sprouts will grow to replace. That's pretty exciting. I have to pace the job search thing, can get burnt out on it sometimes. A little gardening and fresh air, might do me good. I like that you're feeding yourself, with your own grown food!""
B: ""I love being able to just go out and pick my own food - it makes me feel really at one with nature. I would really recommend getting outside and growing something - especially when you spend so much time behind a computer screen. It's good for your mental health ""
A: ""Agreed. It's also something to be mindful of, you have to nurture and maintain it. I try to be careful about what responsibilities I take on... can barely keep my house plants green! Still want to though. ""
B: ""Hey it's the effort that counts - I killed a lot of veggies before I got the hang of gardening!""
A: ""I hear you, yes, it's a process definitely. Two steps forward, one step back. I've been thinking about Romaine lettuce, love that in salads. You have fave plants in the garden?""
B: ""Oh I love Romaine too! I think my favourite veg to grow are tomatoes though, you get to pick them when they get to your colour preference - green or red!""
A: ""Tomatoes too, they are so productive a plant. Cherry tomatoes are a fave, I like how they can have a smokey flavor sometimes. Green tomatoes, haven't eaten many. You fry them?""
B: ""Oh yeah they need to be fried to really enjoy them - I quite like growing chillis too! I love spicy food.""

A: ""That's a good one too. Been a while since I played though. Should I take it back up?""

A: ""I currently have a Dodge Ram 1500 but am thinking of getting a Ford F150. Do you have any info on trucks that you could help me with?""
B: ""Of course, I drive a Ford F150 myself and I would highly recommend it. It has good hauling power and a very powerful engine. In any case, try getting a truck with 4WD if you can.""
A: ""That's what I have now and I tow a little bit so it would be helpful to continue that. Do you use your truck on the farm a lot?""
B: ""Definitely, it is a must have if you work on the farm. I use it to transport farming material, sometimes even livestock if other transport vehicles are occupied.""
A: ""Wow, Ford's must be one tough truck! I am not positive I would transport livestock in my Dodge...""
B: ""I'm sure you could, however I always recommend using a more specialized vehicle if you can. Are you particularly interested in having a truck with more bed space or a bigger cabin?""
A: ""A bigger cabin, I think... What would you recommend? I don't do a ton of transport so I think the cab would be more beneficial.""
B: ""If you don't transport often, a bigger bed isn't really necessary. Its usually better to have a bigger cabin, so more people can be in the car. I know it would be great if more people could carpool with me as I drive my truck.""
A: ""That would be nice. My gas mileage isn't great. I wish I could carpool so it wasn't so wasteful.""
B: ""MPG is another thing to consider for trucks as well, although more modern trucks are much more efficient than older models. Still, they end up being more fuel inefficient than say a sedan or even a coupe.""
A: ""I was looking at trucks and it made me wonder how reliable has your F150 been?""
B: ""It's been good to me. I know some people don't like em, but I've always been a Ford fan.""
A: ""How much will it pull? I'm thinking about getting a couple of horses and I know horse trailers are pretty heavy to tow.""
B: ""Oh I'm not sure about that, I don't pull things too often. But it's never gotten stuck in the mud at my parents farm! Do you have horses?""
A: ""Not yet! I'd love to get some but I'm not sure how much it will cost in total, you know? Gotta think about all the little things not just feed and boarding. I may just wind up getting big dogs instead.""
B: ""I've been around a bunch with my parents farm connections, but I don't know a ton about them. They definitely look like a big commitment, though.""
A: ""Your parents have a dairy farm, right? How's that work going?""
B: ""Pretty good. It's kind of the only work I've ever known, will probably take over some day. I love taking care of the cows.""
A: ""Cows seem so sweet. That's good, I suppose, because they're SO huge! Do they ever frighten you?""
B: ""They can get a little rowdy at times, but not too frightening. I'm used to it. It's like having big dogs, when you see them come up from calves they're not as scary.""
A: ""Yeah, I suppose that's true! They're beautiful animals. Are they friendly, like do they come up for pets and scratches, or are they more like...meh?""
B: ""Depends on the cow. The one that I raised like a pet loves scratches and playing. Others just kinda want to do their own thing.""
A: ""I did it, I bought a new truck!""
B: ""Nice, what did you end up getting?""
A: ""I ended up buying a Ford F-150""
B: ""Welp, I can't argue with that choice. My F150 has been going strong for years. Are you going to pull horse trailers with it?""
A: ""Yes I am going to pull horse trailers with it.""
B: ""It should do a good job with that. Of course, you will lose gas mileage when pulling but that is normal. Did you ever get any big dogs?""
A: ""Yes I do have big dogs""
B: ""What? You went ahead and got some? I remember you saying you wanted to but didn't know you already did. What did you end up getting?""
A: ""I ended up getting them because I liked them""

B: ""That is insane! Must be pretty awesome to see in person. MotoGP bikes are around 200mph too, but I've never seen that in person. ""
A: ""Yeah with how fast they go, they need so much protective equipment too!  I know that NASCAR drivers are primarily wearing fire prevention suits.  I think they wear way more protective gear in motor bikes!  Can never have too much protection when you could easily fall onto the road! Haha do you have a lot of your own equipment then?""
A: ""The latest MotoGP event will be on TV in 7 hours, are you going to watch?""
B: ""Oh 100% I'm excited to see some racing! Are you looking forward to it?""
A: ""Definitely. Wonder what new cars will be up. Love being there in person though. Been getting beer and snacks lined up for the show! ""

A: ""You feel like you are part of something, even if you can't be there just now. We'll have to catch up after the show, who won, all that. Been thinking about your garden, how's that going?""
B: ""Yeah we need to! It's going good - a lot of my tulips are starting to show now and it's really making me smile. I'm just waiting to see what other flowers start to show themselves. Do you do any gardening?""
A: ""Mom used to have a flower garden, but I'm not much of a gardener so far. Thinking about it maybe. Tulips, I've seen some tulip fields that look like magic. Bet you have a few fave tulip colors?""
B: ""Oh I love all colours of Tulips - I've been to Holland before and those guys love Tulips even more than me. I've started to try and grow my own veg recently but that's been a lot of trial and error""
A: ""You definitely have a point. I may consider gardening, you are inspiring!""
B: ""I just love being outside and spending time in nature and not stuck inside all the time!""
A: ""Holland, as you mentioned, yes I've thought about those wooden shoes they are always on about. Wonder if they're comfortable? hehe. Trial and error, got that with gardening. I've  killed a few. We'll have to learn more!""

B: ""I have not had a chance yet.  I'm still trying to figure out who has the best deals for prices.  I can't believe how expensive it is to fix one!  It's so hard to spare the money when you have so many other expenses, ya know?""
A: ""That's frustrating. They make them so hard to fix without taking it right to the original company who basically will charge you the price of a new phone. What broke about it again?""
B: ""The screen.  One of my grandkids was watching youtube videos and dropped it and the screen just shattered.  I bet you're smart enough to not let your kids use your phone!  ha!""
A: ""Hey, it happens. Lets just say they don't use it now, but I've had something pretty similar happen haha. I buy really cheap phones, and then I keep my last one around as backup incase I break one and need a quick replacement. I could send you my old one if you need something for a bit. ""
B: ""That would be great!  I've learned my lesson!  Never again!  The grand kids can use their own devices that their parents buy them if they want to watch YouTube!  Although I think YouTube is terrible anyways!   When is your next Rolling Stones concert happening?""
A: ""I know, there's so much crazy stuff out there. They don't have any shows around here until this winter. I'm looking at two events, either in October or December. ""
B: ""Will it at least be indoors or is it still warm outdoors in the winter there?""
A: ""Yeah thankfully. There is a big stadium they can close the roof on. Nice to be able to sit down for it unlike some shows where you're just standing around a field. ""
B: ""I've seen those stadiums!  They're pretty cool!  Much nicer than the shows in the fields!  How's your step mom doing?""
A: ""Ups and downs. She is pretty tired some days. She has a great spirit about it though, so that's pretty admirable ""
B: ""That's great that she's staying positive.  That mindset always helped me get through the hard times!  Sometimes positive thinking helps more than you'd think!""

A: ""I used to make large batches of banana bread.  It was something that was a bit nutritious and could be packed up well for travel.  I'm not a fa n of McDonalds.  Home food is better""
B: ""Yeah, I totally agree. Home food it way better. You also have that sense of pride. Do you think if you have cooked it yourself, it seems to taste better? I definitely do!""
A: ""For sure, plus I like knowing whats in my food""
B: ""That is one of the main issues when eating out. Although they are somewhat transparent, it is a bit of a pain trying to access the ingredients list. Have you ever asked what's in things when you eat at a restaurant?""
A: ""I don't eat out very often.  When I do I try not to think about whats in the food, knowing will make me feel bad about eating it.""
B: ""I guess that is probably wise. So, do you take care of your body in other ways then? Running, going to the gym etc?""
A: ""i jog around the neighborhood to stay in shape  about 2 miles a day""
B: ""Is it very picturesque there? My surroundings are pretty standard and boring. I would love to hike down some beautiful routes""

B: ""Wow, he sounds like he'd be the perfect sidekick!  What type of dog was he?""
A: ""He was a yellow lab. He was very friendly and loved people. What type of super powers do you think your friends have?""
B: ""We all have different powers that help us work together.  One can go invisible and another stretches and another can move really fast.  Today we foiled a plot to poison the food in the orphanage.""
A: ""I'm glad you were able to stop the bad guys. Have you had any luck finding a dog as a sidekick? You would have loved my lab.""

B: ""Only two of them were acquired at the same time. They are brother and sister and I got them both from a breeder. The others are all rescues. I find it enjoyable to know that I helped out a helpless animal. In fact, I'm always open to rescuing more so I could imagine having up to nine or ten cats.""

B: ""That's a good idea! Maybe I'll start with acoustic to see if I enjoy that, then invest in electric if I ever get decent at it. How long have you been playing?""

B: ""Hello. I'm leigh. I'm at a park I've never been to.""
A: ""Cool. What park? I won homecoming queen and went to the park that night""
B: ""Not sure. I was just exploring the city and found it. How old are you?""

A: ""I'm in band at school. I make straight as! What instruments do you play?""
B: ""I play trombone, alto sax, baritone, and trumpet. You?""
A: ""I play the sax. Do you run? My goal is to run a k!""
B: ""I don't run. I'm constantly moving at the shelter I work at though.""
A: ""You should try to run! Its fun! Moving is good too!""
B: ""No! I'll start violin as a new hobby, like my father.""
A: ""I did play the violin last year in band. I didn't like it""
B: ""It isn't for everyone. My dad made his living. I will try.""
A: ""Did you go to homecoming when you were in school? I had a blast at mine""
B: ""I did not go. Who did you go with?""
A: ""What is it like working at a shelter?""
B: ""Sometimes hard, the stories you hear are pretty sad. But it's always uplifting. Everyone is always pretty thankful for the help. ""
A: ""That's good, yeah I imagine some of the things you would hear are upsetting. It's very good that you help people. How did you get into that line of work?""
B: ""I just started volunteering one day in highschool to get some hours for graduation. I didn't expect to do it long but I felt so needed there and the work seemed so important to me. ""

B: ""Wow, that's more than I've ever run. I just can't push myself like that. ""
A: ""I didn't think I would like running but I actually do. Have you found any new parts of the city?""

A: ""it's good you're willing to explore new things! the hard thing with running is it makes you hungry but you can't always eat when hungry or you'll eat back more than you burn so it is a delicate balance. but I love to have a cheat day once a week to eat whatever treats my heart dsires!""
B: ""How often do you get a cheat day?""
A: ""usually onc e a week, sometimes twice if i've worked out a lot. I usually track my calories but on cheat days I don't, and let myself have whatever I want for the most part""

B: ""How was it? The weather has been terrible recently, did you manage to find a window in which it didn't rain?""
A: ""it's was great! I didn't really feel like it since the weather been crazy but after i finish i felt relaxed again. Yeah i looked at the weather and seen that i had a good hour before it would start again. Do you think you would try running one day?.""
B: ""I have tried running before but only in short bursts. My knees have been giving me a lot of trouble lately. I have booked a doctor's appointment so hopefully a fix can be identified""
A: ""oh okay, hopefully you can find some relief and fix the problem. I love running but when my knee start hurting i give myself a break. That's way i think walking would be good for you because it would help with your knee and is a good workout. how long has your knee been giving you trouble?""

B: ""Three!  Katie, Sally and Ken, they keep me company when my Mom is at work. She works late at night and brings home bags of dollar bills!""

B: ""Yes Milely!  She listens to me tell stories about stuff when I'm waiting for Mom to come home.  With Miley, I'm never alone!""
A: ""In the alleys, are there any foodstuffs that you're likely to pick up? Leftovers?""
B: ""Stores just throw out perfectly good stuff all the time!  We save money so Mom can buy her ""Stuff"" and then we go home and she sleeps all day until it gets dark again.""
A: ""Ah, that makes sense. Sounds pretty tough. Actually reminds me of when I was growing up in Somalia. I'd have killed for some fast food back then.""
B: ""Somalia?  Was there shooting every night like it is here?""
A: ""My favorite subject was dance. I did very well, so well, in fact, that I just received word that I got the job I wanted as a dance coach at a high school!""
B: ""Omg that is great, I would love to be a dancer when I am older. ""
A: ""If you work hard, you could totally do it! It's best to start young!""
B: ""My mom cannot afford to put me in classes. We can barley afford food. ""
A: ""Maybe she could be your teacher? Since your mom is a dancer, you have a unique advantage!""
B: ""She does not do the style of dance I would like to do. I want to be a ballerina. What style of dance do you do?""
A: ""I do ballet! A friend of mine owns a studio where they offer some scholarships. Your mom should look for something like that in your area!""

B: ""Thank you so much, you just made me so happy. I cannot wait to tell my mom. ""
A: ""I've just contacted my friend who owns the dance studio.  She said there'd be no problem for your mum to speak to her.""
B: ""Oh, okay. That's cool! Do you also take ballet classes at your friends studio?""
A: ""I do work out there yes, and dance at the studio. I keep thinking about being paid to teach, although right now, I help others, I dance too. Do you like to dance?""
B: ""I don't mind dancing, but I prefer coloring. I have a doll named Katie that is a ballet dancer though and my mom is a pole dancer!""
A: ""Yes, yes she is. It is cool that you enjoy your dolls, and have one that dances ballet. Bet your mom likes that too. How's your turtle? ""
B: ""Miley is good. She told me an exciting bedtime story the other night about a magical place in the middle of the Earth. Have you ever considered getting a turtle?""
A: ""I like seeing turtles, and hearing about them. Taking care of them, with my busy schedule, might be hard. I really love hearing about Miley. That turtle sounds like great company!""
B: ""Yeah, Miley is a dream. She helps me feel safe in this rough neighborhood and keeps me company since I'm alone a lot.""
A: ""I like knowing you have company when you're in such a situation. I send good thoughts and prayers to you and Miley. Any other dolls that you want to introduce me to? ""
B: ""Yeah, it's nice to talk to someone who grew up in a similar situation. You give me hope for the future. I don't have any new dolls at the moment, but I'm hoping for a new one soon. Maybe my next doll will be a dance coach, like you.""
A: ""That would be great! Your ballet dancer doll and the dance coach can play together, like we play here, when we text. You're creative! ""
B: ""Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking about! If only I could find a coloring coach, then Miley and I would both have coach friends.""

B: ""We have a pretty decent sized yard, and a nice dog park in our neighborhood. But, if I do need a walker, I know who to call!""
A: ""Haha, good to know! There is a lot more competition now, loads of people have started up dog walking business' near me. ""
B: ""I imagine it's an easy business to start, but hard to keep with it. How long have you been doing it?""

A: ""It should be fine. It is pretty flexible and most people understand. What about your work?""
B: ""I guess it could be a nice break from studying sometimes too, getting outside and walking around. It's been fine. Work is work, ups and downs. I can't complain though. Pays the bills. ""
A: ""I have to know! Did you get a dog last weekend?""

A: ""I find rivers, but we could find a local lake or something to practice on. If we bring a friend they could sit with the dogs. Does your lab swim at all?""
B: ""Nice, I bet rivers are a bit more complicated and dangerous? My husband would definitely come with us, so he could mind the dogs :) He does swim, but I'm not sure he enjoys it that much .. He always looks really flustered when he comes out .. a bit like me! ""
A: ""It's not too dangerous depending on where you go. This sounds like a nice day though. I'll pick up some food and we can have lunch or something. I can bring some balls and the dogs can chase them around. ""

A: ""I am excited, it's been a long time in the works. I think I will. I'm staying in town, so I think it will be a nice way to take a break from studying. ""
B: ""Yeah sounds like a plan, you need something else to take your mind off the everyday grind! So how many dogs do you tend to walk at a time? I can't imagine walking more than one - he's an absolute nutter even when he's on a lead! ""

A: ""As I always say, if you've got it, flaunt it! Try wearing clothes that accentuate that unique feature! I could use some help with hanging heavy objects like chandeliers and such. Your powers would be very helpful. ""
B: ""Yes, they really could be of use! I don't mind helping you lifting heavy objects so that we can redecorate your house! I appreciate your suggestion on my appearance. Maybe we could set a date and time to get together and tackle both issues at once?""
A: ""I think that's a good plan! What does your schedule tend to be like?""
B: ""I am pretty open to be honest. What sort of heavy objects would we be working with though? I may need to plan and prepare before we get together.""
A: ""I have a few chandeliers, and there are some heavy urns and sculptures that I need to move out of my garage.""
B: ""Okay, that doesn't sound too daunting. I am thinking maybe early next week we could probably get everything in order, if your schedule will allow? Are you going to be referencing a theme or anything for your new house decorations? ""
A: ""That would work perfectly! I'm going for a classical theme. Lots of marble and plaster and such. I think you'll like it!""
B: ""That does sound lovely! I think maybe we can take inspiration from your home decorating to my appearance possibly? ""
A: ""Are you still going to the doctor often for follow up appointments?""
B: ""Yeah, I have to.  Fortunately my telekinetic powers keep things from bumping into my heart. but i still like the doctor to check things out.""
A: ""I think it is best to have a doctor check everything out. You never know if need any extra help. What led to you needing a new brain?""
B: ""The old one wasn't working quite right.  I couldn't make anything move with it.""
A: ""Was it always broken like that, or did it suddenly stop working?""
B: ""Well, it never could do that, really, that's just a perk with the new brain.  The real problem was that my telepathy started working backwards and everyone could read MY thoughts!""
A: ""Wow that could be a problem. I am not sure I would people to read my mind! Has your new brain changed the way you decorate?""
B: ""Yes, that's why I'm not so busy. I just tell the paintbrush to go to work on it's own, while I try to read the minds of people on TV.""
A: ""That must make it so much easier than having to do the painting. Although I enjoy the feeling of a brush in my hand.""
B: ""See? I knew you were going to say that!  ""
A: ""Do you know I am thinking about at the moment? I will try to hide it from you.""
B: ""You are thinking that your new chandeliers might fall on your head.  Don't worry, I'll use my powers to keep them in place for you!""

A: ""Hello. How are you today?""
B: ""Good today. Just cooking some mexican food. I cooking but am not very good.""
A: ""Oh I like mexican food, but my favorite food are cheeseburgers""
B: ""I inherited some money and bought a yacht to travel, I try different foods traveling""
A: ""I help out at a soup kitchen since I grew up poor.""
B: ""Cheeseburgers are great, I try all kinds of foods everywhere I go, gotta love food.""
A: ""Yes, do you like war documentaries? I do""
B: ""I like travel logs and have been all over the world for years since high school""
A: ""Sounds great, I'm retired, I was a gym teacher""
B: ""I need a job and will put my yacht up for rent. I could teach.""
A: ""Sounds like a good plan, what would you like to teach?""
B: ""Economics would be my first choice.""
A: ""That sounds good, I bet you'd be a good teacher.""

A: ""Watching was documentaries, how about you?""
B: ""I like cooking shows. I should probably take some classes to improve.""
A: ""What was the most beautiful country you have visited? Or at least give me your top 5, I would like to hear it.""
B: ""My favorite region is the Caribbean so I would say top five are Jamaica, St. Lucia, Aruba, The Dominican Republic, and Barbados.""
A: ""Wow, you've really seen a lot of the area! I've been to the Dominican Republic, but haven't been to any of the others yet. But now that I'm retired, I'm hoping to take more vacations - especially cruises!""
B: ""Yeah, cruises are the best. It's like two vacations in one. The trip there is a vacation and then when you dock, you have another vacation exploring the country.""
A: ""True. Not to mention all the food you can eat! And an on board gym to balance it out...haha. I've got to stay in shape because sometimes I still substitute teach if they need someone for the gym classes. ""
B: ""Yeah, lol. There is nothing worse than a gym teacher that is out of shape. I'm thinking about teaching economics online so I can still travel the world.""
A: ""That's a great idea. Would you be able to teach from your yacht? I'm sure the students would love to see that!""
B: ""Yes, I can teach from my yacht because I have a satellite internet system installed. As long as the weather is great I can get online and my yacht would serve as motivation for them to manage their money well too.""
A: ""That's so true! I'm sure you'll be a great economics teacher because you've lived it, and have so much real life experience to share. And telling about all the places you've gotten to visit will be motivating as well!""
B: ""So, have you seen any good documentaries lately? I have a Netflix subscription that I watch sometimes in the middle of a trip.""
A: ""Have you seen Dawn Wall? That one was amazing. It made me want to go to Yosemite! You'd have to find another mode of transport besides yacht though...""
B: ""No I haven't seen that one yet, but I've seen Free Solo, which is about a similar subject so I think I'll like it.""
A: ""Have you applied to teach economics anywhere?""
B: ""Not yet but I am considering my options. Have you seen any good war documentaries recently?""
A: ""Yes, I have seen a few and I have rewatched a couple that I have found really interesting over the years. Do you have any upcoming travel plans?""
B: ""No plans at the moment, I want to sort out my teaching platform first. But once that's done I will start planning for real.""
A: ""Okay, that is so nice that you will be able to teach from your yacht! You will still be able to travel all over the world.""
B: ""That's the plan! I love the carribean but can't wait to travel to Australia and the Maldives ""
A: ""I have always wanted to go to both of those places, I really wish that I would take more time to travel.""
B: ""Won't you have time to do that now that you are retired? ""
A: ""Yes that is what I am hoping for but I always seem to make an excuse for why I can't go. I really need to make it a goal.  Have you tried any new food recently?""
B: ""Oh, I went to this new fusion restaurant, it was indian-chinese! Interesting combination but it was delicious! Quite spicy. How about you?""
A: ""We recently got a new hamburger spot in town. They put anything you can imagine on their burger but I just stuck with what I usually get. The burger was still very good.""
B: ""You're making me hungry. I haven't had burgers in ages. ""
A: ""I am thinking about traveling across the USA.""
B: ""Really? why the sudden interest in travel?""
A: ""Oh, I've been thinking about it for some time. I'd really like to see some of the National Parks.  I definitely want to include Yosemite on my trip.""
B: ""That sounds exiting. Any states in particular you want to visit?""
A: ""Well, there are a lot of National parks in the western part of the country.  Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, etc. I think I'll rent an RV.""
B: ""That sounds like a good idea. I know there are some nice parks around Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Virginia?""
A: ""Yes, I've been to the Smokies, and the Everglades. I think I'd rather travel further west this time though. I've never been west of the Mississippi.""
B: ""Western United States is extremely beautiful so i know your going to enjoy it.""
A: ""Maybe I'll even get to the Redwood forest!  Have a lot more time on my hands now. When I was working I could only take short trips close to home.""
B: ""I have never been but i have seen pictures in textbooks and it looks very cool.""
A: ""Yeah, I've always been impressed. I think I'm going to start taking two vacations a year. One in the states, and one abroad or in the Caribbean.""

B: """"Who Knows"" featuring Chronixx. It's a really cool song.""
A: ""I'll give it a listen to when I have the chance. Have you had any troubles recently with your work in the convenience store?""

A: ""I finally checked out Protoje. You were right! He's great! Can you recommend some other artists you like?""
B: ""Ah, what a great artist. I really like a lot of his music. I also like Jesse Royal when I'm listening to that type of music. I can send you my playlist!""
A: ""Ah fair enough, he's a man though and I don't listen to male artists! I think I saw you working in the store last weekend - do you know if you guys managed to get any organic vegetables in this week? ""
B: ""Fair, I'm sure there are plenty of great female artists too. I just think of the vocals like an instrument in the mix rather than a gender. We get our shipments on Tuesdays. So come early Wednesday morning for the good stuff!""
A: ""Yeah I understand, but I feel that the music industry is just too male orientated so I want to show support to just females ya know! Great news, I'm glad you guys finally got on board with the Organic food, I can't stand the taste of the mass produced stuff! Did you see the new electric car that came out last week, I definitely think you should replace your Nissan with this one! ""
B: ""I have to agree with that, support diversity on all fronts where you can. Hmmm I haven't. I was thinking about electric. I don't drive it very far and I think it'd be a good idea. Who makes it?""
A: ""It's made by Honda, so it's still Japanese which is good, and seemingly reliable :) If you had a charging station at your house it would be perfect - especially if it was solar powered!! ""
B: ""I was looking at solar panels too. We still have some good tax credits here, but I get a decent amount of shade. Who installed yours? I'd love to have a few, even if they only end up accounting for a bit of my power. Was it expensive to install yours?""
A: ""It did cost a little bit to set it up, I can't remember the name of the company to be honest, i'll have to have a look and let you know! Apparently it takes about 5 years to recoup the cost, but then it starts paying you for your energy! All the frogs legs you can cook without having to worry about the power you're using ;) ""
B: ""Haha, yeah I'd be a good long term investment, and probably increase the value of my house as well. I'd appreciate that yeah, gotta start going green. ""
A: ""I rarely use any power now anyway, since I stopped shaving my body hair keeps me warm - I can even use my armpit hair as a scarf when it gets too cold! ""
B: ""Wow, that's intense. What do you do in the colder months?""
A: ""There's a green energy expo downtown this weekend you might want to check out!""
B: ""Oh, that's excellent. I want to talk to some installers to check prices for solar. Did you find it difficult to choose your provider?""
A: ""I did a lot of research and i found out that the tesla solar panels are the cheapest and the ones that look the nicest.""
B: ""That's interesting. I figured they would be the most expensive ones out there. I guess I haven't really done my homework!""
A: ""They are extremely affordable and they save alot of energy. ""
B: ""Are you planning to come by and get your veggies this week? We just got lots of interesting greens, and some wild-looking carrots.""
A: ""You already know it i am making chicken soup this weekend so i need to find the freshest veggies.""
B: ""I'll set aside some onions for you as well. We didn't get any new red onions this time, as I heard a big corporation is buying up all the red onions in the area, but we have some nice yellow ones.""
A: ""Dang it, red onions are my favorite for the soup. Its okay though i can skip out on the onions this weekend. How is Taylor Swift like?""
B: ""She was kind of a regular person, you know? I thought she would be a snob, to be honest, but she was polite and smiled a lot. Have you ever met anyone famous?""

A: ""it is going well, I am going to easily do the marathon. Maybe not a good time but I will complete it. I thought that sailing was hard work? Does it not keep you fit?""

B: ""The older ones do, and I think the youngest will start in a year of two when they're able.  It certainly makes things easier being able to take them all to the baseball diamond and just letting them play on their own.  Organizing their team practices on the other hand is a nightmare...""
A: ""I can't even imagine trying to coach little ones!  How old are the ones you coach? I remember when mine were little and played sports!  The attention span was awful!  They'd be in the field picking flowers while a ball rolled past them!""
B: ""I've coached ages ranging from 6 to 11.  There's definitely a lot of variability in terms of skill.  Some of them are really into it and very talented, others can struggle to pay attention.  It's always a crapshoot what the team is going to look like.""
A: ""Do you think that your sons and their baseball team would make a good subject for your photography?""
B: ""I take pictures of them at their games and practices.  Every now and then I can capture a movement that is awesome on film.""
A: ""That sound's good. I imagine a good action shot would look great as a big canvas or something.""
B: ""I think so.  Have you thought about getting back into painting?""
A: ""Well I have been considering photography - there is alot of amazing street art near me and I think they would make great prints. Any tips for me?""
B: ""Lighting is important but just having fun with it is more important.  Keep clicking until you get the shot you like.  What is the street art about?""
A: ""There is so much of it and it's all very different. There is a whole part about climate change near by with gorgeous scene of wildlife and nature. What is your favorite thing to photograph?""
B: ""Oh that sounds lovely.  I love to photograph nature and the sort of stillness in it.  Sunrises, a butterfly on a flower, things like that.  I will take a photo of anything though, always have my camera with me. My boys always make fun photography subjects. Have you heard from your children?""
A: ""I think to start out I should try to photograph lots of different things to see what works! Unfortunately not, I was hoping they might call this weekend but no :(""
B: ""That's a great idea.  When we get together this weekend, you will get a feel for it.  Oh, that's a shame.  They may be busy, have you tried calling them?""
A: ""Yes, I am looking forward to getting all your advice! No, I normally always phone them but I get the sense  it's an inconvenience so I don't bother anymore. ""
B: ""Oh. I am sure your not an inconvenience.  But I understand always being the one to call...people seem to forget a phone call works both ways. Was thinking we could get something for lunch this weekend...what do you like to eat?""
A: ""Were you able to go out and photograph this week? I hope your boys are doing well!""
B: ""I did go out to do some photography, but fell and broke the lens on my camera.""
A: ""Oh no! I have heard they are expensive. I hope it isn't too much to replace it.""
B: ""It was my telephoto lens that I just got. It was quite expensive but I had purchased the insurance so should be able to replace it without out of pocket costs.""
A: ""That must be a relief. I would feel so bad if that happened to me. Can you work with other lenses in the mean time?""
B: ""I can, but was excited to get some new shots of things that I haven't been able to capture before.  There is an eagle nest with eaglets that I am trying to photograph.  Can't do it without the lens that I just cracked!""
A: ""That must be disappointing. Do you develop your own photos as well?""
B: ""I would love to develop my own photos, but with five kids, I don't have enough rooms in the house for a dark room.  ""
A: ""That is true. Do your boys also enjoy photography?""
B: ""Nah, they enjoy sports and videogames.  Shocking right??""
A: ""Hahha. Do they play on any organized teams?""
B: ""Hmmm, that is an interesting question...I organize their team practices, but I can assure you they are not always organized.  Sometimes it feels like I am just corralling cats.""

B: ""I play music. I'm going to be a rockstar.""
A: ""I hate drugs and don't drink either what kind of music do you play?""

A: ""I'm sorry but I don't think you ever told me your name.""
B: ""My name is cletus huckleberry. Nice to meet you.""
A: ""I recently went to a great cafe that just opened that features local bands.  It is nice to go there instead of a bar in the evenings.""
B: ""Its good that we agree on the live music scene! I just wished the crowds didn't drink so much beer there!  What kind of music did they play?""
A: ""Typical coffee-shop music, some acoustic stuff. It was pretty good. I always prefer live music. Yeah, it was nice to be at a cafe where it was mostly coffee and smoothies! How have your bagpipes held up? Have you still been playing those?""
B: ""I hurt my lips on them last week so its been collecting dust for a few days. I plan on getting back soon though and play some new songs. Do you think the cafe would like my bagpipe playing?""
A: ""Oh no, I hope you feel better soon! I think they would honestly. They're looking for local artists to build community and get their own name out there so you should definitely look into it! It's definitely unique. Do you write all the music you play yourself?""
B: ""Thanks for the feedback! Its hard to find gigs that like Scottish metal played with a bagpipe. Sure, I write all of my own music. Have you ever heard of ""Shake your Bum Bum""? That is one of mine.  ""
A: ""It's definitely unique, but interesting enough to get people's attention. I haven't heard it, but I'll have to look it up! I'm always impressed by people who can write their own music. Hey, maybe the cafe will pay you enough so you can start saving up to move out! How is that process going?""
B: ""Well, the folks have been getting a little tired of doing my laundry.  They said they love having me live in the basement but last week I cam home and the locks had been changed. I had to climb in through a window. Whats up with that?""
A: ""Whaaat that's crazy! Have you asked them about it?""
B: ""They said they didn't know anything about it. What is really strange is they still haven't given me a new key. Maybe I could crash on your couch?""

B: ""I have been craving a good folk concert, with acoustic or just a small band. Thanks for the news. Curious what kind of music, or band you may be thinking of? ""
A: ""He's an acoustic guitarist, from what I understand. Plays in the style of Jim Croce. I love Jim Croce!""
B: ""Classic, Jim Croce. Now I have one of his songs going through his head, ""Time in a Bottle"" - kind of a haunting song, you think?""
A: ""Yes, I think Time in a Bottle is one of the most beautiful songs ever!  Croce did a lot of story songs too.""
B: ""I sure hope he was paid for his writing. Actually maybe I should research who wrote Croce's big hits. Do you like to sing? ""
A: ""I think he wrote most of them himself.  I envy someone with that talent!  I like to sing.  Other people don't like me to sing! haha""
B: ""I hear you there! hehe. My grandma used to laugh and say, ""You better be good, or I'll sing!"" She wasn't much of a singer either, but she sang loud sometimes. ""
A: ""Can you sing? Not that I can imagine you can sing while playing your bagpipes, but I mean in generaL""
B: ""Actually I love to harmonize with other singers, love to have just voices, or a cappella. Love simple melodies and harmonies. ""
A: ""So do I!  You do have a fair amount of musical talent!  writing, singing, playing an instrument.  I wish I could do any of those!""
B: ""It mostly is, for feeling good or just getting emotions out sometimes. Especially those old ballads, really can work through things. Performers need an audience too, like you ""
A: ""I was able to make a reservation to the cafe two hours ago to see the acoustic guitarist. I was wondering if you wanted to come along, I'm sure you will enjoy the atmosphere of the event, and the food at the cafe is pretty good too.""
B: ""Oh, that is great! Is it an all-ages event? Only because I am only 19, so I want to make sure I will be allowed in.""
A: ""Yup!It is at a cafe and not a bar so all ages are welcome I think it would be just up your alley. ""
B: ""OK, perfect! What kind of music does this guitarist play?""
A: ""They are very foksy which is why I thought of you. I've heard them do a cover of our favorite Jim Croce song.""
B: ""I hope they play it at the cafe! That would be such an experience to hear it together and sing along. I think it would be a very special moment.""
A: ""Me too! I was wondering have you ever played your bagpipes in front of a crowd?""
B: ""I haven't played in front of a crowd. It is actually a big dream of mine but I have such bad stage fright and I worry I won't be good enough and that everyone will laugh at me.""
A: ""Well if you ever want to start with an audience of one I can be your guniea pig. ""
B: ""I appreciate that! How about we get together before we go to see the live show?""

A: ""Nice, I've been focusing on Python.  I think I want to be a data scientist for a sports or entertainment company and I think it'd be a good entry language for that.""
B: ""Oh okay. With your sports background, I think you'd be a shoo-in for a position in that field. I'm primarily looking to do freelance work because your skills are all that matter, not if you have a degree from a fancy university.""
A: ""Yeah that makes sense, especially if your mom is going to make you stay in India.  Has her mind shifted on that at all?""
B: ""No, she is very desperate that I stay in India because I'm her only son and she depends on me. Also, she is afraid I will face discrimination as a foreigner in America.""
A: ""Dang, maybe you can get her to compromise and let you try living somewhere like Hawaii.  It's great here and not nearly as far from India as the mainland states.  Lot's of different demographics here too, I doubt you'd see any overt discrimination.""
B: ""That's a good idea. The warm climate would be a plus as well. I experienced snow once on a trip and I wasn't a big fan of it.""
A: ""Yeah the weather here is amazing, it's one of the best tings about Hawaii! Unless you decide to go way up near the top of the volcanos you'll never see snow either.""
B: ""Yeah, and I imagine there would be lots of places to practice my swimming. I'm more used to pool swimming, but I would love to practice some open water swimming.""
A: ""Why do you want to work with Apple products?""
B: ""Apple is one of the most innovative companies in the world. Not only would it pay well but I'd love to help design iPhones and other products.""
A: ""It does seem like a good job. I imagine it has really strong job security, I don't think iPhones will be going anywhere anytime soon! ""
B: ""I don't think so either. You mentioned that you created music recently? Maybe you could get some of that on iTunes one day!""

B: ""I do actually. I like to hike as well. Going for nice walks is a great past time as well. Nothing would ever top swimming for me though. What about you? What do you like to do outside school?""
A: ""I did track when I was younger. I still run and since I moved here, I've learned to surf. I'm having a lot of fun with it! It took me a long time to pick it up though.""
B: ""Despite loving the water and swimming, surfing is not something I really got into. Tell me how it was. I've always been curious and wondered if it was worth trying. Not to mention, some of my swim students also surf.""
A: ""Have you ever tried skateboarding? It's a lot like skateboarding in that the main thing is learning how to keep your balance, only at least in surfing when you fall it doesn't hurt! The equipment can be expensive but when you're first starting out a lot of bigger beaches will have surf outfitters where you can rent everything you need for the day, and they usually have someone to give lessons too! ""
B: ""Well I might have to give it a try. With me being a swimmer, if I fall off, I would surely be okay. I did skateboard when I was younger but I had a small accident and kind of moved away from it. I'm a bit more interested in surfing thanks to you.  Any tips you can give me?""
A: ""Hmm. Well, the way I started off was on a 'boogie board' which is sort of like a surfboard only you rest your upper body on it instead of standing. If you get a good wave with it you kind of feel like Superman! That kind of gets you used to what you have to do and how to move a flat board to maneuver around the wave.""
B: ""It does look like quite an amazing rush! My students and I went on a trip once to the beach. A couple of them were showing off their surfing skills. They tried and tried to get me to do it. I didn't however and told them no. Now I may be able to surprise them once I learn how. I appreciate the help!""

B: ""Maybe I can teach pluto abc song! I want to be a dog just like him!""
A: ""You can! That would be fun. How old are you little doggy?""
B: ""I do not know, what do you mean? Do you like chocolate?""
A: ""I just found out I am going to Disney next week. I can't wait to get some candy.""
B: ""That sounds exciting! What kind of candies do think you will get this time? Also, will you bring some back for me to try?""
A: ""I like licorice and salt water taffy. Do you like those old fashioned candies ?""
B: ""I enjoy almost any type of candy. So, are the licorice and salt water taffy the special candies that you get in Disney World? As long as its not chocolate, you should bring some back for me to try.""
A: ""Ok, do you want me to Bring you some Pluto themed toys ?""
B: ""That would be awesome! I can pay you for them. I don't want it to be a burden on to you. Do you think you'll bring back some Mickey themed toys for yourself?""
A: ""I think I have enough Mickey stuff, but I now that I will buy some more. I think I will have to give away some of my Mickey toys to make place.  Do you want some ?""
B: ""If you are going to get rid of them, I would be happy to take them. I have a niece who would love them. I think she would be very happy to have a few new toys. ""
A: ""That would be my pleasure. I like to know that they will be still be appreciated. Do you keep all your Pluto toys ?""
B: ""Of course! I have a bit of a Pluto shrine going between all the toys, shirts, and other general paraphernalia related to Pluto. I assume you do something similar for you Mickey gear?""
A: ""There are some items that I keep, but I like to have a rotation. So I never need more space and I still have new stuff. Do you think you will need more space for your collection ?""
B: ""If I keep accruing more Pluto related items, of course. I don't intend to get rid of any of my stuff related to Pluto. I do like the idea of decluttering my space by getting rid of some of my Pluto items but I just can't do it. I take pride in my collection.""
A: ""Maybe I should look into selling my Mickey Mouse items.""
B: ""Honestly now might be a good time to sell, lots of people seem to be interested in childhood collectables lately.  Do you need the money?""
A: ""I want to buy more Mickey stuff but I really don't have the space for everything so that's why I was thinking of selling.""
B: ""Ah, that makes sense! I've got the same problem.  I'd love to have some new Mickey toys, but I've got so much already and I can't bring myself to get rid of anything.  Do you know what you might sell?""
A: ""I'm not sure yet. I need to sit and go through everything before I decide. I think I should also look at the prices things are currently selling for?""
B: ""Yeah that's what I'd recommend.  If I were going to sell I'd look online to see which of my items would sell for the highest prices and focus on those.  I love all of my collectables equally, so I'm okay selling off just the highest price ones and keeping the rest.""
A: ""Yes, I get that. I really want new things so I don't mind selling some. I will need to do that this weekend before I go to Disney next week. ""
B: ""If you need any help researching what to sell just let me know, I love this kind of stuff!  It's so exciting you're going to Disney too, anything new you want to see this time?""
A: ""That's great, thank you. I'm not sure , I think there is a new ride which I haven't been on yet so that's exciting. I generally don't have a plan when I go. ""
B: ""That's cool, sometimes a big part of the excitement is just walking around and exploring to find what's new rather than relying too much on other peoples' advice.  It's really fun to just immerse yourself while you're there.""
A: ""Definitely I love just walking around taking everything in.""
B: ""I need to go to Disney sometime, it's sad that my parents haven't wanted to take me and I can't find anyone else to go with.""
A: ""I really enjoy my Mickey Mouse hats, what are some of your favorite collectibles?""
B: ""Oh my gosh I love the hats too! But I really really like the figurines oh oh and I have a snowglobe with mickey in it!""
A: ""Wow, I will have to look for them when I'm there. What else do you like to collect?""
B: ""Well I really like Pluto stuff too. Have you ever collected any of those? I have a watch with Pluto in it and his arms move around the clock!""
A: ""I prefer Goofy to Pluto, actually. Did you ever see him sing the song about sailing? It's so fast, and I still want to learn the words.""
B: ""I don't think I have. Man I really want to go to Disney. You are so lucky!""
A: ""Maybe you can go sometime this summer after all. I'm sure your parents would let you go if you offer to help them with things.""
B: ""I wish. I tried so hard but they just don't to go. Grownups! What is your favorite thing to do there?""
A: ""I just like seeing the characters. They are really fun to get pictures with. Did you ever meet any famous characters before? Or people?""
B: ""No not really. I saw a guy once at the grocery store with my Mom that was on tv in our town. But nothing huge. Did you?""
A: ""That's really cool. Was he on the news? I saw the guy from Breaking Bad once at a store too. I didn't talk to him though.""
B: ""No he did a commercial for a store in our town. He wasn't really famous I guess but he owned a chocolate store or something. I hate chocolate!""

A: ""Thank you so much. It is all about clean eating and being self aware""
B: ""Makes sense, you'd be a good role model. Any children?""
A: ""No, not yet. Do you?""
B: ""Yes, a new little one on the way too""
A: ""I started my job and I am loving it so far.""
B: ""That's awesome! So you have clients already? How does it work exactly, do you meet with them in person once a week or so?""
A: ""I don't have a bunch of clients yet as I only just started. But, I have a few and am starting to build up a portfolio of clients. Generally speaking, I keep in contact with them via E-mail or phone and do a weekly or bi-weekly meet up to make sure they are on the right track. If you want to try it out, I can get you scheduled with me or another agent for a free month trial.""
B: ""Oh that would be awesome! I'd totally try it for a month. Not sure if it's for me but there's no harm in giving it a shot. Especially with the baby coming soon, I need to make sure my life's in order""
A: ""I think it would be good for you! I'll speak with one of the other people who work here about setting up an appointment with them to get started. How soon until your next child is born? If its soon, I can try to schedule for your first appointment to be after that.""
B: ""It's not due for another 4 months, so I'd be happy to get an appointment sooner! I have a kayaking trip I'm busy planning for right now, but maybe in 2 weeks if there's something available?""
A: ""That sounds good. I'll look to see if anyone has availability to add a new client in two weeks. ""
B: ""Nice! What did you do before being a life coach? It seems like such a perfect fit for you ""
A: ""I was a part-time athletic trainer. I feel like my experience as an athletic trainer is what landed me this job. I know that the people interviewing me were impressed by my previous work history. I had done all kinds of different sports and general athletics related to it. Ironically enough, I actually have never been kayaking though!""
B: ""Ah that makes a ton of sense, they seem like similar jobs at least in some respects. Encouraging people and helping them meet their goals. You should totally try kayaking! It's super versatile, it can be relaxing on a lake or thrilling doing whitewater""
A: ""I've always been interested in Kayaking but never really had the opportunity to get in to it. Do you think you could help teach me a bit and maybe we could go on a day of kayaking together?""
B: ""Yeah that would be so fun! It's really easy honestly, there's a bit of skill with steering but once you get the hang of it it feels super natural.  ""
A: ""Turns out I have a new client that also likes to kayak. I told him you were going to teach me how to do it. He said he would give me pointers as well! ""
B: ""Are you sure you want to do it? I can definitely teach you the basics if you are willing to go with me on my next trip.""
A: ""Yeah definitely! I feel like water sports are the final frontier for me when it comes to athletics.  It also seems like a great way to forge bonds with clients.  How late in your pregnancy do you expect to keep kayaking? ""
B: ""I'll keep going until I feel like I can't do it anymore. So, who knows really? Anyway, do you want to start out kayaking by doing something calm (like a lake) or should we aim for a river with rapids?""
A: ""Hmm, do you think it'd be easier for me to learn the techniques in calmer water?  Or is it better to jump straight to rapids since that's where I want to end up eventually? ""
B: ""I think it would be better to start out in calm water. Once you have been able to practice the basics for a bit then we go to moving water. I think you'll be fine though. ""
A: ""That sounds reasonable, I definitely want to make sure I really know what I'm doing if I'm going to be kayaking with this client later on.  It'd be a bad look for me to not have the fundamentals down before I meet with them.""
B: ""Did you ever get your kayak that you were talking about buying? If not, I have one that you can borrow for the trip.""
A: ""I haven't bought anything yet, I was going to hold off until I tried it first to make sure I could do it.  It'd be wonderful if you'd let me borrow one!  Are you sure it'll fit me? Haha""
B: ""Yeah, it'll fit you no problem. I suppose it's a good idea to wait. You don't know yet if you are going to want a kayak for calm waters or for rapids. ""
A: ""Okay cool, do you know which calm lake we can go to?  I'm not very familiar with the places around here that allow kayaking.""
B: ""There is a pond/lake up by where my trip is going to be. It's also not far from where the river is located. It'll be a great time!""
A: ""I found a kayak for a cheaper price that I am going to purchase. I don't need to borrow yours anymore.""
B: ""That's awesome. Where did you find the kayak?""
A: ""I found it in the Facebook Marketplace. There are a lot of interesting things there.""
B: ""Interesting! I will have to check on there. I have a lot of baby things to buy soon.""
A: ""There might be some there! Babies are so exciting. Do you have everything planned yet?""
B: ""Not quite, but it's not my first go round, so hopefully it will be easier this time. I'm not looking forward to giving up the rapids, that's for sure! Have you got any professional advice for people who need to give up something they love for a while?""
A: ""My best advice would be to find something else that really interests you and try to put more focus into that. It's easier to give something up, if you have something else to replace it.""
B: ""That's a good idea. After the baby is born, I'll be super busy, of course, but the last few months of the pregnancy are sure to be a little boring. Maybe I'll subscribe to every streaming service there is so I'll never run out of shows!""
A: ""haha There you go! Disney+, HBO, and Netflix are my favorites at the moment. DO you subscribe to any right now?""
B: ""Just Netflix, but I heard good things about Peacock. Oh, and I got Apple TV free with my new phone, and I want to watch that show Ted Lasso. Have you seen it?""
A: ""I have Apple TV with my phone, too. I don't use it often, though. I have not seen that show yet! I haven't had a lot of time for tv lately.""

B: ""Are you in school too?""
A: ""No. I finished in 1995. What year are in?""
B: ""First year, I just moved here with my best friend for school too.""
A: ""Its great to have friends. I hope you look after each other that's very important""
B: ""So true! So what do you do for a living?""
A: ""I'm in mining but I hate it. What is your field of interest""
B: ""Aside from nursing, I work at a bar to pay for school.""
A: ""Bar work can be fun. You learn so much about human nature. Thank you for caring about others""
B: ""Of course, it is like a live sociology class too.""
A: ""Absolutely!! The subjects are already prepped with truth serum""
B: ""I definitely agree! Good perspective. Why do you not like mining?""
A: ""Today, a wall almost collapsed on me and my crew. The danger is one of the reasons I really don't like the mining field.""
B: ""Wow, I've never had anything like that happen to me at my bar. Is everyone okay?""
A: ""People are mostly ok. A few minor injuries but everyone got out in time, no broken bones or, god forbid, deaths. I might try to get out of this line of work soon, these kind of incidents just keep happening ""
B: ""I'm so sorry to hear that, but I'm glad everyone is mostly okay. Have you thought about going back to school? It's tough to work and to go to school, but I hope it will be very rewarding.""
A: ""Yeah, it's just been so long that I'm not sure it'd work for me. I'll think about it for sure. But I might end up doing a similar job that has less hazards, maybe construction or outdoor work. How's school going for you? ""
B: ""That's a good idea too, I hadn't thought about it but a change of industries might just be right for you. I don't have a lot of free time between my job and schooling, but it's going well, thank you. It's frustrating to not have much time to do the things I would like to do anymore.""
A: ""That completely makes sense, it must be pretty stressful. Are you in any clubs, maybe a band or choir?""
B: ""Oh, I wish, that sounds like a lot of fun. I'm a little shy and only recently moved to town for school, so I'm not involved in any activities at the moment.""
A: ""That makes sense. It could be a good way to meet new people! Since they'd share at least one of your interests. But I get that time management is super hard on top of a job. How do you like working at the bar? Any crazy customers?""
B: ""Yeah, definitely! I'll look into clubs around here. Obviously, bar work isn't nearly as stressful as your job, but you do occasionally run into some very rude customers. On the whole, I really can't wait to get stuck into my nursing and get out of the bar.""
A: ""Makes sense, I was a waiter a long time ago and even though some customers were perfectly polite, it was always the rude interactions that stuck with me ""
B: ""Exactly! You can spend your whole shift with the nicest customers, but one person can ruin your entire workday. I guess you just have to pick yourself up and move on in that scenario.""
A: ""So it turns out that my company is under investigation for unsafe working conditions, as of tonight.""
B: ""Uh oh, so what happens to the mine while it's being investigated? Do you still need to go in to work?""
A: ""Operations are shut down pending an internal investigation. I have no idea when we'll be able to return to the site.""
B: ""Dang, that sounds really serious.  Are you still getting paid?""
A: ""Not from my company, I'll have to file for unemployment benefits. I'm going to take this time to look into school as well.""
B: ""Ouch, I guess you can take this as the sign you needed to get a new job though.  Any ideas what you want to study?""
A: ""I'd like to get a masters in mechanical engineering. I have all my basic classes completed already.""
B: ""Wow, that sounds like a pretty lucrative field to get into.  Will your work experience at the mine help you with it?""
A: ""Yes, it most definitely will. Especially when it comes to knowing the schematics and machinery that we use in the mine.""
B: ""That's good.  I wish I could say that same about nursing, my experience working at the bar hasn't helped my studies at all, hahaha.""
A: ""Are you sure, taking care of patients and customers! lol""
B: ""I guess you can say that, though if my nursing patients end up being like my bar customers I think I might be getting into the wrong field!""
A: ""How much longer until you finish nursing school?""
B: ""Hopefully just a year more! How long would your master's take?""
A: ""Probably about two years. That's still something in the future for me. I'm trying to sort out what to do right now. How are you liking school?""
B: ""I'd like it better if I didn't have to work, too. Would much rather focus on school. How about you? Will you work while taking classes?""
A: ""I think that'd be a good idea. Half and half, if I can. I guess it really depends on class schedules and what jobs I can find. Do you have friends to study with?""
B: ""A lot of people want to study together, but I'm not actually into that. I need to be able to focus if I have any hope of remembering anything! I take it you like studying in groups?""
A: ""I think it depends on the subject. I think some subjects are easier with a group and some are easier on my own. Do you have time for any other activities besides school and work right now?""
B: ""You mean like sleeping and eating? Barely. Anything else just feels like more work! I don't even keep house very well right now. Hopefully there will be time to clean after the semester ends.""
A: ""Aw, hopefully. That will be a nice break. What do you like to do when you have free time?""
B: ""Just listen to music and read, usually. Calm activities away from other people. As you can see I'm not a people person! How about you? What do you like doing?""

B: ""i have been thinking about it, it does sound like a great idea but i have to think about the money and how much it's to cost. i also Volunteer at the dog shelter sometimes so maybe i could get one form there. Do you know what the best breed of dog is for someone like me (old and slow) ""
A: ""I was talking with a friend an hour ago, and they told me their Great Dane is very calm and quiet. I think that would be a good dog breed to consider if you plan on getting one. Hopefully the shelter has one that you can adopt.""
B: ""Those seem like nice dogs, however they are extremely large from what I understand.""
A: ""They are quite big, but if it behaved well; would it be that big of a problem? What other breeds would you consider adopting? I've noticed that most smaller breeds are more stubborn.""
B: ""I think it may be a problem because since I have retired, we have downsized into a condo. I don't think that would be fair to a big dog to confine them into a condo. I was looking at one called a Shetland Sheepdog. Do you know anything about that breed?""
A: ""I don't really know much about Sheepdogs, no. I know they're gorgeous animals, though. I heard they're easy to train as well, but I have no experience with them. Is that the dog you're looking into getting? No other options?""
B: ""That dog really appealed to me, but I am open to other options. Do you know of any small breeds that are not stubborn? My wife wants one that with snuggle on her lap. ""
A: ""I think all small dogs tend to be stubborn. I haven't really heard of any that aren't. They tend to be quite yappy and have a bigger attitude than their body. Haha. They all seem to be harder to train. Maybe if it was mixed breed with a less stubborn dog, then it would be easier? I'm not sure. German Shepherd are pretty well behaved dogs. They're not as big as Great Danes either. ""
B: ""I absolutely love German Shepherds but my wife already said no to that. I think we will have a hard time compromising on this one. Maybe we should just get a cat instead haha...kidding! ""
A: ""I don't have cat and never have. I would definitely probably want to get a cat if anything were to happen to my dog. I heard they're very low maintenance. Might be perfect since you're retired!! Haha.""
B: ""Ok maybe that is a good point. But I don't know if I can really walk a cat. Part of the reason I wanted to get a dog was so that it would force me to get outside and walk every day. I have a step contest with my local retirees in the condo building.""
A: ""I think you wouldn't have too terrible of a time walking a cat if you get it while it's younger. Just do it everyday and often and it should get used to the harness or collar you use. It'll be harder if they're older I assume. ""
B: ""Yes, I don't really see people walking cats in my neighborhood. I feel like my fellow veterans would laugh and make fun of me.""

A: ""Hi what do you do?""
B: ""I go to school. Hate it! Will you be my friend?""
A: ""Sure! You can be friends with my 3 dogs too if you aren't allergic""
B: ""Oh, I am not! I am only 12, though. Will they like me?""
A: ""I think they will. All of them are friendly! Whats your favorite subject?""
B: ""I do not like school at all. And gym is the worst!""
A: ""I'm always walking my dogs so gym activities are fun for me""
B: ""The boys pull my waist length red hair. That hurts!""
A: ""Aww that's not very nice of them. Have you told the teachers?""

B: ""Okay, thanks! What do you like to do?""
A: ""Well I like working in my dog walking business! Dogs are the best""
B: ""Better than kids, that is for sure!""
A: ""I remember back in school the other kids would always be annoying""
B: ""Especially when you are 12! How old are you?""
A: ""I got a new client - the cutest little dog you have ever seen. I think it is has some Chihuahua in it. You should see it trying to keep up with my German shepherd!""
B: ""What a sight that must be to see! Walk them by my house so I can see them!""
A: ""I have a walk at 5pm today. Will you be home then?""
B: ""I will! Perfect! I can't wait.""
A: ""How is school going? I hope it has gotten a little better.""
B: ""Last week was brutal, but this week has been mild. I try to make the most of the good days and not dwell on the bad ones.""
A: ""That is a very healthy attitude to take on it. Kids can be so cruel. Keep your chin up!""
B: ""I have gym class next period and I am dreading it. We are playing dodgeball.""
A: ""I always hated gym class too. I am not athletic at all. I always stood right up front for dodgeball so that I got out asap!""
B: ""Great tip! Thanks for the trick!""
A: ""I will see you later. The dogs are sure to cheer you up!""
B: ""I am looking forward to it. Off to dodgeball :(""
A: ""I have a lot of new clients. I am so  happy!""
B: ""That sounds exciting.  Have you come across any interesting breeds in your dog walking business?  I am curious because I am thinking about getting a new dog myself.""
A: ""I really like Maltese dogs. They are so tiny and cute. But they can be expensive to buy. Labs are nice if you want bigger. Will your parents let you get a dog?""
B: ""Yes my parents are actually in favor of it.  It will be a therapy dog of sorts because of the trouble I am having at school.  They think it will improve my mood and reduce my general anxiety.""
A: ""I am so sorry that boys are making fun of you. Don't listen to them. Things will get better. A dog will make you feel good. They give you such love.""
B: ""I appreciate that and hope things will get better for me as well.  I like your idea of getting a Lab, I think that breed would suit me well.  The question now is whether I should go to a shelter and adopt an older one or get a puppy.""
A: ""From my work with dogs I would highly recommend you adopt. There are so many beautiful dogs that need homes. You can literally save a life. Then they will be your best friend. You can also get a young dog from a shelter, especially a lab.""
B: ""I think I will do that then.  I was just somewhat hesitant because I feel like I am letting down all of the other dogs that are also at the shelter.  Even though I am helping one dog, I feel guilty that I am not capable of helping all of the dogs that I see there.""
A: ""Have you looked at the websites of any shelters near you to see what dogs they have in at the moment?""
B: ""My mum keeps telling me about about a shelter close, but most of them are grown up and I want to get a puppy. ""
A: ""Grown-up dogs can be easier to handle, though. Puppies like to chew on everything, and older ones are often more calm. Maybe consider it? They need homes too!""
B: ""Yes, I know they do. But, I think getting a puppy to begin with would be a good start and then when I am more confident, I can rescue them from shelters. ""
A: ""Perhaps. Do you have much space to keep a large dog?""
B: ""We have a really big garden. Also, I would be more than happy for it to stay in my room, not sure how much my mum would be happy with that though. ""
A: ""That's a good point. Sometimes they could bring fleas into the house, or even ticks! It's good if the dog can have its own bed at least.""
B: ""Really? Are the transferable to humans? I would be scared if I got them ""
A: ""Well, fleas can bite you but I don't think they stay on you. Ticks are a bigger problem because they can carry Lyme disease. I have a friend who got that and she said it's pretty serious!""
B: ""Oooo that sounds serious. I am sure if I was to get a dog from the rescue center, they would have made sure that they don't have fleas or ticks, right?""
A: ""Oh definitely! But you have to protect them with special collars or some drops you put on their skin. Usually you have to use the drops once a month. I'm sure the shelter even sells the drops, but you could get them at any pet store. And don't forget to buy a good leash!""
B: ""I have seen videos of people being pulled over by their dogs when they have them on leashes and the dogs want to run. I am scared that will happen to me and I will get hurt!""

B: ""Yeah, barnaby is a keeper and a great scorpion spotter. I hate scorpions.""

B: ""Barnaby found one in my dad old nascar cars right before I sat down.""
A: ""Ugh. I do not think I could live with them.""

B: ""Lol, yes but cute! I can't wait to meet him and take lot's of pictures.""
A: ""You can probably bring your paints and do a painting of the horse. I know I am going to have my camera with me and take some pictures.""
B: ""Yes, that's a great idea! I'll bring all my painting things with me. Does Saturday work?""
A: ""Yeah, that sounds great I am free all day.""
B: ""Awesome! Sounds like a plan then. ""
A: ""Indeed I am looking forward to it I know it will be a lot of fun.""
B: ""Oh yes! I haven't rode a horse in months, I'm very excited!""
A: ""Do you have any other painting work lined up at the moment?""
B: ""Yes. Someone commissioned me to paint a seascape. I can't wait to get started!""
A: ""That's fantastic.  Is this for a private client or for a public space like a mural?""
B: ""It is at a school. I can't wait to inspire them. Do you display any of your photographs anywhere?""
A: ""Sometimes I post them online.  And sometimes I'll frame photos I really like, or photos of horses I really like.  But mostly I just take them for myself.  When I'm finished training a horse for someone I'll sometimes give them a framed photo of their horse if I have a good photograph of it.""
B: ""That must be a great gift for them! I think they would really enjoy it. You should consider selling some. It can be a great way to earn extra money.""
A: ""I never thought of that, but that's not a bad idea.  When you get commissioned to do a painting, how have your clients usually found you?  Word of mouth?""
B: ""At this point people will share my info with others. When you are starting you can tell people about it. You can leave flyers at ranches or wherever. Make an ad online.""
A: ""That's a good idea.  I'll have to try to do that.  Every dollar can help since school is expensive.  Is your seascape going to be oils or water colors?  And how large a painting is it going to be?""
B: ""I like oils. I like the texture that you can get with that. This one is very large. But I have done things of all sizes. What size are your photos?""
A: ""I like to get them as big as I can while still keeping the clarity, of course.  My camera is pretty good so I can take print pretty large photos and still keep them quite sharp.""
B: ""A photograph can really be a work of art. Do you manipulate them after or what you take is the final product? I am always changing my paintings around.""
A: ""If you have the interest, I would love to commission a painting of my dear Sirius.""
B: ""I would definitely be interested in that! Does your dog sit still well?""
A: ""He can sit still... on a good day. Can you work from a photograph?""
B: ""I can. Both animals and children can be tough to get to sit still. haha""
A: ""Sirius has a mind of his own and can get a little unruly at times. But I think I can get him to pose briefly for a portrait. What size would be best for you?""
B: ""It doesn't matter to me. It depends on how much you want to pay. haha On my end, size doesn't make a big difference. I can make from tiny wallet-sized to large wall-sized.""
A: ""I'm talking about the photo. How about an 81/2 x 11, letter-sized, landscape? I think it will give you sufficient detail to do the painting. As for the painting itself, I'd like something I can hang on my den wall, say poster-sized..""
B: ""Okay. That will do. After you give me the photo, it will probably take me around a month to finish the painting. Is there a particular date you need it by?""
A: ""No, please take your time. Sirius doesn't care about time all that much, and I have my other work to do. I'll get the photo to you this Friday after work if that's OK. ""
B: ""haha I'm glad you have a patient dog. Okay, that sounds fine! I will get everything set up and go through my supplies.""
A: ""I know it's probably hard to anticipate cost at this point, but can you give me a ballpark figure?""

A: ""Phones nowadays have such good cameras and they are very portable and easy. But, no doubt a Canon DSLR is much better when you know how to use it! ""
B: ""That's true about bigger cameras -- it takes a lot of practice to get the right exposure and focus. A phone usually does all that for you! But it seems like you're a natural photographer based on your shots. You have the most important thing, which is a good eye for framing!""
A: ""They are super expensive too. But then, I guess phones are expensive too. Thank you, I am such a harsh critic of myself because I always want to get the perfect shot.""
B: ""It's a good thing phones can do so many things besides being cameras, although I have to admit I like upgrading my phones mostly for the latest camera technology. It's an indulgence to replace a phone so often, but it's amazing how much better they get each year.""
A: ""I sometimes think that companies purposely don't upgrade their phones as much as they know how to in order to facilitate bringing out a new phone. And, that consumerism is, in a sense, stopping technological advancements because companies are trying their hardest to maximise products and monetise technological advancements""
B: ""Well said! I do feel pretty consumerist when I want the latest phone, although I treat it as my only major point of greed. I rarely replace other things I own. In fact the shirt I'm wearing is one I've had since high school!""
A: ""Everyone has their indulgences, I believe they are big parts of our personalities. Does the shirt have any sentimental meaning to you, or is it just one that has maintained quality for years?""
B: ""A little of both, actually. It's a Smashing Pumpkins shirt, but it has also lasted a long time. They just don't seem to make clothes to last anymore. They fall apart so quickly now, unless you buy really expensive stuff.""
A: ""Again, I think it is part of the business model. They make products to have a certain lifespan and therefore they need replacing, whereas years ago they were much more bothered about their reputation - companies, that is.""

B: ""I think you should still contact them. If someone disowns you just for getting in trouble when you're young, they're not a very loyal friend. Lots of people get in trouble when they're young. And if they love films as much as you do, it could be a good way to reconnect with them.""
A: ""I will get in touch, I'm just afraid they don't want to do anything with me anymore. Even though some of them shoplift just like I did, but didn't get caught. ""
B: ""Don't be scared. In life, sometimes people won't want to be your friend because they judge you, but that's fine, you wouldn't want to be friends with someone who would judge you negatively either. When things go wrong, that's when you find out who your friends really are. The important thing, no matter how old you get, is to use your experiences to improve yourself.""
A: ""Good advice. How old is your daughter, by the way? Is that the kind of stuff you tell her?""
B: ""She's 10. As a parent of course you try to give your kids good advice, but mostly they don't take it. As they say, 'a lesson merely heard is never a lesson learned!' Everyone needs to make their own mistakes and learn from them.""
A: ""I agree, just hope the mistakes aren't too bad. Are you still trying to switch schools for her?""
B: ""Yes, but it's not that easy because I'm also trying to change my job at the same time, so I have to do lots of things at the same time. I think she could get a better education at a different school but of course it's harder to get your kid into a good school.""
A: ""How often do you bring your daughter to the park?""
B: ""I take her on the weekends alot when it's not too cold. She enjoys the park a lot. ""
A: ""I really miss visiting parks. There here a little green space at the detention center, but it is not enough. I am looking forward to getting out. ""
B: ""Do you have any idea when you may be getting out?""
A: ""It will be a little while. They are very harsh here in Texas. But it will happen. One day I could be a dr like you.""
B: ""Yes you could. You are still young and you have your whole life ahead of you!""
A: ""I hope so. I also want to have kids one day like you do. It must be great.""
B: ""It is nice. It's like having a friend who is also a mini version of yourself. I wouldn't mind having another.""
A: ""How many do you want? I want a lot of kids one day. And they won't go to jail.""
B: ""Maybe just one more. I don't want too many kids because I still want to live comfortably, both financially and mentally haha""
A: ""They are expensive. First I need to get a job to earn money. ""
B: ""Have you thought of any jobs you'd like to have when you get out?""
A: ""I just asked and was told I will be here for one more year. What do you think the first thing I do when I leave this detention center should be? ""
B: ""I would go and see your mum and thank her for visiting you. Then go and have the best meal of your life.""
A: ""You're so right. If I had money I'd take Mom out to dinner but that'll be hard. Guess it will have to wait till I can earn some money.""
B: ""That is fine, you can make it a goal to keep you track and something to aim for.""
A: ""Yeah. I wish I could make some money on a computer or something. Like fill out surveys and stuff. I can type fast, I think.""
B: ""It might help to get you started but I am not sure if it will give you a long term income. You could always try some free online courses to gain some skills?""
A: ""Yeah, but I don't know if anyone will hire me for a normal job. I've heard it's real hard especially if you don't have work experience. Do you ever work with people that were in detention before?""
B: ""We all make mistakes at point in our lives. Many people are willing to allow others have a chance to improve if you just have a go. Maybe try some volunteer work while you are doing some online work? This way you can demonstrate that are suitable for normal work.""
A: ""Yeah maybe. I could work with kids and help them not make the mistakes I made, you know?""
B: ""That would be a great idea. Not only will it help you but think about all the other kids you might help avoid detention. ""
A: ""For real. It is so horrible here. I wouldn't wish it on anybody ever.""
B: ""If you have learnt from your mistake then it is not completely wasted.""

A: ""Yes, I do like my new home I just get a little home sick at times. I defiantly miss Germany.""
B: ""How long have you been in America?""
A: ""It's been a little less than a month, so I'm still adjusting but it's been challenging! ""

B: ""PIZZA!!! ... what kind of toppings do you like?""
A: ""Mmm, so yummy! I love banana peppers on mine! What's your favorite topping?""
B: ""all meat is my fav!  with extra pepperoni. Hey,,,, the banana pepper reminded me of the stretchy banana you joked about regarding escaping me from juvi ... Escaping is such a temptation but I keep reminding myself that it is less than a month now""
A: ""I am getting my house all set up.  The last of the boxes are unpacked.""
B: ""That must feel so great to be almost completely unpacked!  What state did you end up moving to?""
A: ""For now I'm in California. I moved here because I'm a pro disc golfer and needed to be closer to the pro tour action. My sponsor suggested I move here so that I can play more and make more money at it.""
B: ""That makes sense.  It must be nice to live somewhere with such gorgeous weather!  Do you have any family or friends in the state?""
A: ""Only the people that I know from disc golf. I'll make some more friends along the way I'm sure. Yes, the weather is pretty nice here and much different than where I'm from in Germany.""
B: ""I bet there are lots of other differences from Germany besides just the weather.  What other differences have stood out to you the most?""
A: ""The way people act and drive is really different. The food is also quite a bit different. There are also a lot of differences in how things are laid out and organized here vs Germany. I feel like it's pretty chaotic here, but I'll just have to adapt.""
B: ""I think even people who are native to America would agree that California can be a bit chaotic haha!  What do you think of the food?  Better or worse than the food you are used to in Germany?""
A: ""I haven't had a chance to try much in the way of food. There just seems to be such a focus on fast food here, which I don't really like. Hopefully, I can find some good restaurants that have better food.""
B: ""California has a wide array of restaurants, and there is a big interest lately in healthier options.  I'm sure once you explore the area a bit that you'll be able to find some grocery stores and restaurants that are a bit more appealing.""
A: ""I've found the grocery stores to be very similar to Germany, only the brands are different. I've found Aldi here, which is a Germany chain.""
B: ""I never realized that!  I feel like Aldi definitely has a cult following...I've never really been that impressed with it though.  I wonder if the quality of Aldi stores is different in the states versus in Germany.  I feel that here, a lot of people like to shop at Whole Foods.  Have you ever been?""
A: ""So what are your plans once you are released from juvenile detention? ""
B: ""I am hoping to be able to travel and find somewhere to build a new life with opportunities where my past can be forgotten. Any suggestions?""
A: ""Have you finished high school yet? GED?""
B: ""I have finished high school and I actually have really good grades. I just got involved with the wrong group of people and ended up doing something silly. My best subject is Maths.""
A: ""Then you need to go on to university! You can probably get a work-study stipend. STEM is a great field to work in right now.""
B: ""Hopefully they take my background into account when considering giving me an offer, and not just my silly mistakes. I really do want to go to university. I just worry that I will be judged because of what I have done in the past""
A: ""I don't think you even need to mention it. In Germany, juvenile records are protected and confidential. I think it's the same here. I believe university administrators are mostly concerned about academic achievement. If you have any legal problems as an adult, the adult authorities will deal with it.""
B: ""Oh okay, that is reassuring, thank you! My academic records are pretty flawless because I love learning. I am definitely going to apply to university. Maybe I should use my time left in this detention to sort out my application, could I email you if I have any problems?""
A: ""Absolutely! I'm not a rich person, but If I can help in any other way--time and energy--please let me know.""
B: ""Yes, that's what I meant. Just the know-how and some questions about what they might be looking for me to include in my personal statement etc. Did you go to university?""
A: ""Yes I did. Heidelberg, for medicine. I'm attached to a hospital in San Francisco as a neurologist.""

A: ""Yeah, maybe I could learn something about horses, like therapy with horse. I have not been on a horse since September, I miss it very much. ""

A: ""I don't really feel I know them, so I can't say I like them.  But I do sometimes get amused observing them.  How they dress, what they buy, what they drive, and how they act.  It's very impersonal though.  But I like to guess what I think they'll buy when they enter the store.  Who'll buy cigarettes?  Lottery tickets?  Health food or junk food?  That kind of thing.""
B: ""LOL,,,, I bet that makes the shift go faster. Do you go back to the farm and have lots of animals to care for after yous shift is done?""
A: ""No, I moved off a farm last year and into an apartment.  That's why I haven't been on a horse in months.  I like having my own place but I miss the open space and animals.""
B: ""Oh. I bet that's closer to work, anyway. You mentioned that you want to color your hair. What color do you want to dye it?""
A: ""I was in a pretty bad mood when I told you that and was thinking about dying it whatever color would most annoy my boss.  But now I'm thinking something less extreme that still expresses my gloomy mood, like jet black.""
B: ""Jet black can look exotic. Does your work limit you on being able to dye your hair or have tats or piercings.?""
A: ""There are no formal rules but the boss gives people a hard time about those types of things.  I usually try to keep him off my back and look presentable but he's been more annoying recently so I sort of feel like riling him up intentionally.""
B: ""haha,,, that made me snicker. I wanted to dye my hair bright pink. I suggested it to my dad and he just gave me that ""look"". So I will wait. I do wonder how acceptable it is for a lawyer to have pink hair. What do you think?""
A: ""Are you thinking about becoming a defense attorney, and if so what kind of cases would you be interested in taking. Would you consider becoming a prosecutor?""
B: ""I think I'm more interested in corporate/property law as a career overall, but I might work as a prosecutor or public defender for the experience.""
A: ""That sounds tough. I guess corporate pays a lot more, but it's less interesting. Do you think you'll be able to have pink hair and be a lawyer? Never seen that before!""
B: ""Heh, the legal world tends to be a bit conservative, so probably not. But while I'm in school, I don't see why I can't.""
A: ""True! You should definitely go wild while you can. Are there a lot of people at your school with hair like that?""
B: ""Not many. Blue, but not pink. I'll have to give all of that up once I pass the Bar.""
A: ""That sounds pretty hard. So much reading involved! But in the end you can be like one of those lawyers on Law & Order!""
B: ""Hollywood law? Nah! Real law practice isn't as exciting or glamorous. Mainly it's a lot of research, writing, reading, and filing documents with the courts.""

B: ""Very cool, do you grow anything else in your garden?>""
A: ""the usual's. like tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, green beans, lettuce, strawberries, blueberries.""
B: ""Awesome, I wish I could grow things. I have an apartment, but maybe one day when I have my own house. ""
A: ""You should look into doing container gardening if you have a spot that gets sunlight. there are actually quite a few things you can grow indoors too.""
B: ""I know nothing about this, do you have nay good resources to get me started?""
A: ""I would suggest finding a local nursery and asking the employees there. they are very knowledgeable and you can even buy everything you need there.""
B: ""I will look into that, thanks. How is your health?""
A: ""It's not so great. but that's to be expected. I can at least feel content that I got to live a good life so far. though I do wish to see my grandchildren grow more. even if they are brats sometimes. ""
B: ""I am so sorry to hear that. I think you have a great outlook though. Do you know how much longer you have?""
A: ""doctors said anywhere from 6 months to 1 year. so I'm just trying to live every day to the fullest right now. ""
B: ""That's all you can do I guess. I wish you all the happiness over your remaining days. ""
A: ""Have you looked into starting your container garden?""
B: ""I have! Got some seedlings in my windowsill and keep moving them out when they're big enough. How's your garden?""
A: ""It is going pretty good. I am hoping that the strawberries come in ok, I sometimes have birds getting after them.""
B: ""We get a lot of birds in our garden too, do you get netting to protect your fruit? ""
A: ""I need to. I just need to get a frame built to put it over. Do you have any suggestions?""
B: ""I just use some bamboo canes with netting attached for mine. You still feeling able to get out and do much or have you managed to talk the kids into helping?""
A: ""Ha! They really don't want to help. They will eat the preserves and salsa I make, but don't want any part of the care and upkeep. How are the rabbits doing?""
B: ""Haha, sounds like most kids. Still plenty to look after. People come to adopt them, but feels like two arrive for every one we rehome.""
A: ""I guess they multiply like rabbits! Lol. Do you ever adopt any of them?""
B: ""I do take some home. That's why I decided to do some container gardening. Easier to stop them from eating everything when they get out!""
A: ""I bet that would be a hassle. Rabbits can be really cute, though. Maybe I'll come look at adopting one!""
B: ""They are really cute! I'll bring some over sometime soon for you to spend some time with. They're quite therapeutic when they're on your lap.""
A: ""How many rabbits do you have at home now?""
B: ""We have about 30 Rabbits now and a few of them are pregnant so we are expecting more pretty soon!""
A: ""That's so many rabbits! How do you guys have enough to feed them all?""
B: ""Thankfully, the rabbit rescue has been getting a lot of donations recently meaning that we have a surplus and to stop it going to waste, the volunteers are allowed to take it home with them ""
A: ""Your apartment must be so big to be able to fit all those rabbits! I have a lot of produce from my gardens I could give you for your rabbits!""
B: ""The apartment has a shared garden, and the other residents don't mind me having them in the garden, They love them. What type of produce do you have?""
A: ""I started growing carrots! I also have some crunchy fresh cucumbers if rabbits eat those. I remember bumping into one of the residents the last time I visited! He said something about seeing rabbits in a shipyard container??""
B: ""They LOVE carrots and cucumber. I am sure they would be grateful to be given some. So, thank you! Yeah, one of the residents works with me at the shipyard. and we found some rabbits in one of the containers when we were emptying them. I have no idea how they got there, but given my volunteering, I thought it was quite the coincidence. ""
A: ""I would love to feed them sometime soon! That's interesting haha for a second I thought you might have been breeding and shipping rabbits!! ""
B: ""Noooo, not shipping them, or breeding to be honest. I don't have the space for any more, even the babies that are due to come. I will need to see if some other people want to keep them. Would you be interested?""
A: ""I would love to have a rabbit or two to care for! Unfortunately, I will not be able to take care of them for long!""
B: ""Any relief would be great. It would give me some time to find some permanent homes for them. At the minute, it seems like not many people want rabbits, but I am sure I will be able to find some people to lighten the load for me ""

A: ""Nice, I play the violin. I try to get a three mile walk into my day.""
B: ""Violin, oh my gosh! My father was a pro violin player and he showed me a lot!""
A: ""Wow! Did you ever consider violin? If I'm not practicing, I usually unwinding with a book""
B: ""Yeah I actually play the violin, guitar, drums and piano.""

A: ""How was volunteering at the homeless shelter? Do you plan on learning any other instruments?""
B: ""It was good.  I feel like the time I put in there actually helps someone.  There are so many homeless people out there now that shelters like the one I volunteer at can use all the help they can get.""
A: ""Maybe when the kids get bigger they can help out. Right now they volunteer at the pet shelter, but that is just because pets are not as sketchy as some people are. I want them to be old enough to know basic self defense before letting them work with adults. ""
B: ""That is a good idea!  There are some people out there for sure that would hurt a child.  What about you?  Do you do any volunteer work?""
A: ""I help with the PTA and we do bake sales and food drives for the famililes in the school that need assistance and cannot get any. It isn't much, but last year we were able to help a single mother get new tires and a radiator with the funds we raised to help her be able to keep her job. It was a good feeling.""
B: ""That is really impressive!  Every bit of help anyone can do for another counts.  Have you been playing your violin lately?""

B: ""No violin lately. I've been busy with piano lessons.  You'd be surprised just how many people out there are wanting to learn to play now! ""
A: ""Oh no, I do know. My daughter wants to learn it, but every time we pay for lessons, she goes for a few of them and then just stops. ""
B: ""Really?  Why is that?  Is it that she doesn't like the piano or she isn't connecting with the teacher?  ""
A: ""We have tried 3 different instructors and she is always excited the first day and then by the third or fourth lesson she says it is impossible to learn, her hands are too small and she can't stand anything. It is heartbreaking. ""
B: ""Oh no!  You tell her that that is not true! Her hands are not too small! She can definitely learn how to play.  Why don't you let me give it a try and see if I can get her interested in playing?""
A: ""I spoke with my daughter about what you said. She said she'd like to meet you about the piano lessons. ""
B: ""Oh, perfect. I am free all of next week in the evenings. Is that something that works well for you two?""
A: ""That would be great! Hopefully we can come by Thursday. Do you offer lessons for both violin and piano at the same time?""
B: ""I can do, yes. My father will be around on Thursday too - I am sure he would be more than willing to help with the Violin. He is so passionate about it""
A: ""I'm so excited! I'm a big fan of your father's work. How has he been lately?""
B: ""He has been well. Managed to fall up the stairs the other day and banged his knee, but that doesn't affect his violin playing thankfully. How are your parents?""
A: ""Oh no, make sure he's more careful! I haven't talk to my dad since the divorce and cheating, but my mom is doing great now with her new man!""
B: ""Hopefully he treats her better. She really is a loving person and she deserves it. I try my best to help him, but he refuses to succumb to using an assistance stick. He will just have to at some point.""
A: ""He seems great too. They both visit and spend time with the kids regularly, much more than my dad ever did! Parents can be so stubborn sometimes haha""
B: ""As they always say to us, ""Do as we say, not as we do"". No matter how old I get, he still maintains that mantra. At this point, I am used to it. That is such great news! I am sure that will continue, I am certain of it.""
A: ""Thank you for your support! Has your father found anyone new? It's been some years, but that's okay if he isn't looking for anyone too.""

B: ""Cool what did you win for?""
A: ""It was in the 100 meter dash! I got 7 seconds!""
B: ""Wow!! I just run on my treadmill lol""
A: ""Nothing like a good exercise!""
B: ""Yes and I love the rower machine""
A: ""Row row row your boat gently down the stream, when you see a crocodile...""
B: ""Lol nursery r h y m e s""
A: ""I ran into a friend just two hours ago, and I heard they were selling an old rower machine that they no longer use. I think you would be interested in buying it off from them, would you like to get in contact with them?""
B: ""Oh, that's awesome, thanks! I'm a bit low on money right now, but I'm definitely interested in buying it a bit later. Do you know the price they're asking?""
A: ""I believe they are askign $100. If you think you can buy it, I bet they would work out some kind of payment play or layaway option. ""
B: ""That sounds extra cheap... I know that they're your friends, but still. Are you sure it's in a working condition?""
A: ""Yes, I swear by it. They don't really care about making money off it, they just want it out of their house. Let me know if you are interested. ""
B: ""Then sure, I am interested, that's basically free considering how expensive rower machines are. Thank you a lot! How are your cats by the way?""
A: ""They're good. I think one has a stomach bug though, I'm going to have to take her to the vet. How are your dogs?""
B: ""Oh, you should. I don't like going to vet but my pets' health is worth it for sure. They're great, thanks for asking :) I've started running in the morning and taking them both with me, it's so fun!""
A: ""I bet they love that. Running outside is so much better, especially if you have fun companions. Have you tried to hike with them?""
B: ""No, not yet... They don't really like going out, which is weird I guess haha. I'll try to take them with me when we go hiking next time, thanks!""
A: ""That is strange, lol. Well maybe it's not for them. I wish I could take my cats out, but I think people would give me strange looks. ""
B: ""It doesn't matter what other people think, don't worry! Just take your cats out and see if they like it, in the end it is all that matters.""
A: ""How are you finding the rowing machine? Is it helping your exercise?""
B: ""Yes, I'm quite happy with it.  It's in really good shape--better than I expected--and I like having it at home to use when the weather outside isn't conducive to running.  So thanks for facilitating the purchase for me with your friends!""
A: ""I'm so glad you are liking it!  I remember when I was training for the olympics, I had to run outside no matter what the weather was.  It's great to have an indoor alternative!  I still like to run, but not when it's too hot outside!""
B: ""Yes, I'm sure that for Olympic training there's no choice but to forge ahead, regardless of how you feel or what the weather's like.  Was 1992 the only Olympics you got to compete in?""
A: ""Yes, I'm afraid so.  I ended up with an injury in 1993 and that pretty much ended my competitive career.  Now I like to coach other athletes such as yourself....""
B: ""Do you currently coach anyone you think has a shot at winning a medal at the Olympics?""
A: ""No, I just work with local athletes. I have to stay pretty close to home due to my cats, and especially now that one of my cats is ill. I'm really worried  about her.""
B: ""Oh no!  Has it not gotten any better?  I think you better take her to the vet if she hasn't started to improve by now.""
A: ""Yes, I've been thinking that. It's hard to take her out of the house but I guess I have to do it. Do you have a near by vet that you trust your dogs with?""
B: ""Yes, actually I do.  One of my dogs ate a rock one time and had to go to the vet.  I really trust them even though I've only been once.  Would you like their name and phone number?""
A: ""Wow that sounds scary!  Yes, please sendme the information if you get a chance. I'm sure if you trust the that they will be able to help me, hopefully without costing a fortune!""
B: ""Yes, I don't remember them being costing too much.  Of course I was mostly just glad that my dog was okay.  I'll have to look for their information though.  I'll get it to you as soon as I find it.  Have your cat's symptoms been getting worse?""
A: ""My cat that I was worried about because he was ill is getting worse.""
B: ""I'm so sorry to hear that! Do you know what is wrong with them or do you have to wait until you take your cat to the vet?""
A: ""I don't know, but she's an older kitty and has some chronic health problems.""
B: ""Oh, I can relate to that. One of my dogs is older and has diabetes. Do you know when you'll be able to take them in to the vet? ""
A: ""Later today for sure. She went off her food yesterday morning and still isn't eating yet today. She's drinking water, though, so it might just be something transient. Still, I don't want to chance it.""
B: ""That's very good that you'll be able to get them in today! I find its best not to wait, especially when they have chronic issues. Hopefully it's nothing serious!""
A: ""Hopefully! We'll have to see. My vet's a good guy, does a complete assessment, so I'll know more later in the day.  She's a sweet animal and I'd had to lose her.""
B: ""That's so great. It's so important to have a caring vet! I'll pray for your cat to get well soon! Why don't you tell me what the Olympics was like. Maybe that will get your mind off your worries.""
A: ""It was such an exciting time for me, really gave me an opportunity to excel in my sport. The training over the year before was the most difficult thing I've ever done, but it was worth every second!""
B: ""How often did you train?""
A: ""Daily, in the early morning and late afternoon, for two or more hours. Had to follow a strict exercise and dietary regimen in addition to the sprint training. Socializing was rare, because I was exhausted half the time, and my coach wanted me in bed at a decent hour.""
B: ""haha That sounds worse than living with your parents! I guess it really did pay off for you! What kind of exercises helped you with sprinting?""

B: ""Do you have any pets?""
A: ""I have a cat. His name is spook. What about you?""
B: ""I have a turtle. I named him leo""
A: ""That's cool. How did you get a turtle?""
B: ""My best friend got it for me. He lives across he street""
A: ""That was sweet of him. Do you like music?""
B: ""I like what barney sings!""
A: ""You may not know them, but the who is a great band!""
B: ""Daddy listens to them all the time!""
A: ""While googling some songs that Barney sings, I found that there are so many and even hour length Barney song compilation videos on Youtube. Amazing!""
B: ""I like watching videos a lot. I can always watch cartoons and Barney without asking. I want to see it!""
A: ""I can send the links to your mom so she can make sure they are okay first. but that's pretty cool that you can watch barney whenever you want to. ""
B: ""Okay, she told me I can decide what I watch now. So I can be my own boss now. I also want to watch the movie Pet Cemetery, like my neighbor friend. ""
A: ""I'm just going to take a guess that if you are someone who likes Barney, you probably are not going to like watching pet cemetery. I'll still send the videos to your mom and she can decide if you can watch them.""
B: ""Well, sometimes my mom is too strict and she doesnt let me watch what my friends watch. I dont think its fair and was thinking about sneaking to watch the pet movie. Since it has the word pet in it I should get to watch it.""
A: ""I think your mom is just strict because she knows about more things than you do. You should probably listen to her.""
B: ""I do listen to her. She tells me when dinner is ready and when its pizza I run as fast as I can to the table. I like to listen sometimes.""
A: ""that's a good start, but it's easy to listen when it's something you want to do anyways. ""
B: ""Ya, it is really easy to listen when she makes me pizza. Its easy to listen when she lets me do what I want to do.""
A: ""You should try listening when it's something you don't want to do. I bet they teach that on Barney. ""
B: ""I know that Barney always says to clean up your toys and be nice to your friends. I think he wasn't talking about my mom though. I am not sure? ""
A: ""My cat Spook did something really funny and I want to tell you about it.""
B: ""LOL what did Spook do? Did he spook you?""
A: ""He has been doing this thing where he taps his food bowl on the floor repeatedly when he wants to eat. It's so cute and so funny. I'm going to try to get it on video.""
B: ""Haha can you send my mommy the video? Cat is my favourite animal but daddy says no cat.  What is your favourite animal?""

A: ""Poor doggy. If you don't mind, what happened to him? Was he just old?""
B: ""Mommy said he was old and went to heaven because of that. How old is your kitty?""
A: ""My cat has been acting so funny today! Its like she's on a sugar high, but I didn't give her anything out of her ordinary diet. ""
B: ""Maybe someone has been sneaker her candy.""
A: ""That's a good point and very possible. Have you ever given your turtle sugar?""
B: ""Yeah, but he doesn't like it. Mom and Dad said I shouldn't have given Rex chocolate. He liked it though.""
A: ""Oh no, your dog can get sick if you give it chocolate. My cat likes gummy worms but they are not good for him. ""
B: ""Maybe she'd like real worms!  ""
A: ""Maybe so, but I'm not sure. I named Spook after a ghost. Where did you get the name Rex?""
B: ""He was born before I was.  Dad said it was because he looked like a dinosaur.""

A: ""you can pick whichever one you want. I don't know the sex of them yet though. and they will get to about 5lbs. you should look into getting a big rabbit hutch. they actually don't do very well in the small cages. not unless you plan to let them free roam the house and just use the cage for when you can't supervise. ""
B: ""Okay, I'll get the hutch.  I think I'll take one fawn and one black. That way I can have a variety.  Should I get them lettuce from the grocery store or is there something else I should feed them?""

B: ""I'll do that!  You know, I am kind of excited about getting them! I've been wanting a pet rabbit for a while now!  I watch videos of pet rabbits on You Tube and they are so cute!""
A: ""they make great pets! and you can litter box train them too!""
B: ""I didn't know that!  Is it hard to train them?  Having them freely about the house could be fun!  ""
A: ""it's not hard. definitely look up training tips though. they love to be a part of the family.""

B: ""I just got them.  They are so cute.  I really can't imagine eating them, but I'm the same way about deer.  I know lots of people eat deer meat.  What made you eat the bunnies?  Were they pets or did you have them specifically to eat?""
A: ""Yes, I had them specifically to eat but now I just have them as pets. Did you name yours?""
B: ""I haven't named them yet.  I want to name them something cute.  Any ideas?""

B: ""Wow! I can not even count that high! I have a pet though. Do you?""
A: ""No but I should I heard they're great companions""
B: ""Dad got me a german sheperd to help on the farm. Where do you live?""
A: ""In california but I want to move to france""
B: ""France is a long ways away! Will you drive there?""
A: ""No way I'd die on the way il fly there""
B: ""Do they let people as old as you on planes, mister?""
A: ""I'm visiting a shelter later today to possibly pick out a cat.""
B: ""That sounds great! Do you already know which one are you looking for or are you going to decide on the spot?""
A: ""Well, I am looking for one that is really calm and one that will let me hold it. I am hoping to know the minute I see it. I am open to gettin any kind female or male would work for me. ""
B: ""I remember my dad picking our sheperd, it was so hard. When you see a lot of cute animals and every single one wants to be adopted, it's hard to pick just one.""
A: ""Yeah, that is a pretty good point. What if end up getting two? I sure hope I can decide on just one. I dont want to trip on an indoor pet so that is my main concern too.""
B: ""Don't worry, I'm sure it'll be fine :) Are you going there by yourself or with someone to help you?""
A: ""I have a home health nurse who drives me places and helps me get around. She is really kind and is patient with me when I am movin slow. I was wondering if your dad still has his dog? ""
B: ""That's good, I'm glad that she will be there to help! He doesn't have him, I have him :) He got it for me as a birthday present. And I'm really grateful for that, best present ever!""
A: ""Dang, that is a good deal there. I am happy for you! It is nice to have somebody to take care of and to care about. When you hit my age someday, you'll find out a lot of people that you know pass away and it can get lonely.""
B: ""Well, that's just how life goes I guess, nothing we can do about it. I'm sure you had a lot of fun in your younger years, so there's no use to get sad now :) A cat is a great idea though, it will definitely help with the loneliness!""
A: ""Oh, boy, you got that right! I was lightening fast and a very hard worker but liked fishing more. I have some fish stories that would knock your socks off.""
B: ""Haha I sure as hell would like to hear them! A bit later though, gotta run for now, have something to take care of in the garden. I hope you will pick the best cat they have, good luck :)""
A: ""How is your garden coming along?""
B: ""It's coming along fine!  Everything is growing right on schedule.  All of this rain we have been getting lately has been great for it and it keeps me from having to spend time watering!""
A: ""That is really great! What kind of plants are you growing?""
B: ""I am growing tomatoes, yellow squash, okra, and bell peppers.  With summer fast approaching having some fresh vegetables around will make meals light and easy!  Hey, I can fed ex you some if you want when they are ready.""
A: ""That would be great, are you sure it wouldn't cost too much? Do you preserve any of your vegetables?""
B: ""No, don't worry about cost. I'll be glad to do it!  I do make salsa and jar it.  I get some cilantro, jalepeno, and onions from a neighbor in trade for some of my okray and squash.  Do you want me to send you a couple of jars?""
A: ""That would be awesome! I love homemade salsa, it always tastes better than store bought. How is your dog doing?""
B: ""He's fitting in and learning the ropes perfectly!  You know, he's really going to be a big help around here.  Have you gotten a cat yet?""
A: ""I am still looking. I have been checking out the local shelters to see if there's a rescue I can adopt. ""
B: ""Wonderful idea!  There's always a ton of cats and kittens at the shelters.  Are you looking for something specific?""
A: ""No, just one that seems to fit me. I think that if I see the one, I'll know. I just need to get out and start looking. Have you been able to train your dog?""
B: ""I'm working on it.  The main thing is to get him used to the cows and know how to handle them if necessary.  ""
A: ""I found a rescue cat that I adopted.""
B: ""Aww, that is great that you decided to adopt it. Did you name it yet?""
A: ""I've named her Fish! I went with my son to go fishing for an hour and we did not find anything. Just as we were heading back, this little cat appeared with a small fish!""
B: ""What a great story, I am happy you gave Fish a home! Has she been adapting well to being home with you?""
A: ""She is the cutest little cat ever. She has stayed mostly by my side these past few days and has been a great joy to have around. I hope I live long to care for her.""
B: ""I hope so too! Have you made any plans to move to France?""
A: ""I'm not sure I want to anymore. I'm too old to travel and here is where family is and Fish now! Do you plan to stay on a farm forwever?""
B: ""Yes, I did have dreams of moving when I was younger but as I get older I realized I wanted to be around family and help out on the family farm that I will someday take over when my dad retires.""
A: ""You are a very hard worker and I know your dad will be especially proud of you for taking over! You'll always have food to eat as well""
B: ""That is true, my mom is helping me to learn how to cook and store a lot of the things from the garden. I am thinking about opening a stand at the farmers market to sell all of the vegetables I am growing.""
A: ""That's a great idea, I would love to be your first customer! I will bring Fish along and my nurse. Hopefully it will be very close by.""
B: ""That would be great, I plan to join the local farmer's market so it will be very close. I will bring some of my homemade salsa just for you!""

A: ""What kind of games does Steven like? ""
B: ""Steven has been obsessed with Stardew Valley lately. Have you ever played that game?""
A: ""I have never heard of that game do you know what it about? Maybe it would be a good game to try at the game party I am hosting.""
B: ""Stardew valley has a multiplayer mode so it would be perfect for your game party. It is about farming, and you roleplay as a farmer who inherits their grandfather's farm.""
A: ""Wow that sounds awesome maybe I could make a menu around the game. Maybe some farm food. Do you have any suggestions of what else to have with the burgers? ""
B: ""Definitely parsnips and starfruit. Maybe some farm fresh eggs and demon mayonnaise to go with it. Do all 5-6 people eat meat? Maybe there should be vegetarian options if any of your friends are veggies.""
A: ""Maybe some parsnips but I don't think starfruit grows locally here. Yes there are some vegans in the group probably do some Impossible Burgers. Is it true that the Impossible Burgers are really popular at Burger King?""
B: ""i have heard they're very popular! something about how the impossible burger works well with burger king's flame broiled taste.""

A: ""I would enjoy having you and Steven come to my party. ""

A: ""That is nothing. What kind of video games do you like ? It is just to make sure that everyone will have fun at my party. ""
B: ""I love simulation games like The Sims. It's so fun creating characters however you want them to be""
A: ""Do you play RPGs ? It looks right your alley. You decide on how to solve quests. ""
B: ""I don't, actually. Maybe I should give them a try, they sound fun""
A: ""Yeah. But the most fun ones are very complex, you should try Disco Elysium, it is less combat oriented and the story is great. ""

B: ""Right now I don't work. I quit my job to go into the monastery a while ago and haven't found the need for a job as I get my basic neccessities taken care of here. So being a cancer survivor...wow! I'm SO happy for you! That's a scary thing to go through. ""
A: ""Yeah, even if the doctors told me it was a small cancer, I could not stop think about it. That is why I did learn about meditation in the first place. What event made you want to study meditation ?""
B: ""Cancer as well...a close family member was diagnosed in 2006. Thank God she has been in remission for about 14 years now, but the C word is scary, no matter what type or size. ""

B: ""Well it also is one of the riches salmon areas in the world! A lot of it is only accessible by boat or small plane, so it is very wild area as well.""
A: ""Salmon is my favorite food, and the oils in it is good for people with cancer or recovering from it! I bet eating it fresh is amazing. That sounds really cool. How is meditating going?""
B: ""It's been going good! I have did a few 8 hour meditation sessions last month. How about you? ""
A: ""I am trying to see how cold effects meditation, so if I move up to Alaska, I can see about any outdoor meditation. I even went as far as trying to meditate in a walk in freezer, but I kept getting interrupted. I am trying.""
B: ""Oh wow that is very interesting! I don't think you have to come as far as Alaska to find cold weather! Have you thought about places like North Dakota or Maine?""
A: ""Oh no, I already was thinking about going to Alaska. I just wanted to do some trials before going. I am also trying to do meditation with different oils and scents to see how they effect it. I find that peppermint and lavender are not good for meditation. One makes you want to get up and go and the other will put you to sleep haha.""
B: ""Nice! I go the minimalist route when it comes to meditating, just however things are in the moment. Where do you currently live?""
A: ""I live in New Mexico now, but it is not my final destination. I like to move around every six months or so to pass on some lessons and enjoy a different area. I want to see the entire world, one continent at a time.""
B: ""Oh wow I have never been to New Mexico. In fact I have barely been to many other states! ""
A: ""Ok I tried a quick meditation with lemon essential oil and it went great!""
B: ""That sounds lovely, Lemon and Lavender Essential oils are the best. Although Lavender smells great and helps with more things. The smell of lemon is just sometimes what you need. ""
A: ""I've not had much success with lavender.  how do you feel about vanilla?""
B: ""That is also one of the best smelling oils there is however it doesn't help much with healing. I usually use Vanilla if i just want to feel relaxed. ""
A: ""Sometimes relaxing can be the best way to begin to heal. I'm thinking of moving again.""
B: ""Yeah you're right about that one. Oh really, where are you thinking about moving too? ""
A: ""maybe to washington state this time. have you ever been there?""
B: ""You really do like to move. Do you think you will ever settle down somewhere or you just like to see new places too much. I have never been there i have heard great things though. ""
A: ""I don't know.  As long as I keep enjoying new places I'll probably keep moving. at least until I find one place that insists I stay.""

B: ""So how old are you kris?""
A: ""17, but feels older. How about you?""
B: ""Don't be so eager to grow up its not as fun as you may think""
A: ""I know but you get to make your own decisions""

A: ""When do you plan to organize your baby shower?""
B: ""I need to start soon. Are you available to help me, by any chance?""
A: ""I would be honored! Let's go together this weekend and get started!""
B: ""Great - thanks! I am thinking something blue and yellow since it is a boy.""
A: ""Do you want to incorporate animals? Shapes? Disney characters?""
B: ""I haven't gotten that far! You are giving me a lot to think about for this weekend.""
A: ""I have a long run scheduled for Saturday morning, so I will come by afterwards. Probably around noon. Okay?""
B: ""Perfect. I can have lunch for you. I'm sure you will be hungry after a run.""
A: ""That's kind, thanks! Yes, I am planning to do 10 miles, so fuel and hydration will be much appreciated.""
B: ""10 miles! I haven't that far total in my life! You are really amazing.""
A: ""Thanks for the support! I enjoy it. It keeps me thin and stress free.""
B: ""I might try to start running after I have the baby. I will need to get rid of this excess weight.""
A: ""I was talking to a friend an hour ago, and they said they would be excited to come with me to help you plan for the baby shower this Saturday. They have experience in planning for various events, including baby showers. I can send you their number if you want to discuss the baby shower with them in more detail.""
B: ""Oh that would be great, I would really appreciate that! I am still trying to figure out the theme. What would you and your friend like for lunch?""
A: ""Glad we could help! Something probably light, how about salads? How do pirates sound for a theme?""
B: ""Oh, I love salads! Do you both eat meat, just so I know what protein to add to the salads. Oh a pirate theme could be super cute! And we could have everyone dress up!""
A: ""Both me and my friend are both vegans. Glad you like that idea. We could even have some eye patches for people to wear if they wanted!""
B: ""OK I am glad that I asked so I didn't serve you a chicken salad! I am sure I can find some good vegan recipes. I love the idea of doing a photo booth and having lots of props like a parrot, or pirate hats!""
A: ""Photo booths are super cute. I went to a wedding that had one and it was a lot of fun. I like the idea with all the props!""
B: ""So fun! I am wondering if I should hire a professional photographer, or just make it a DIY photo booth where people take pictures with their phones.""
A: ""That's a good question. I guess it would depend a lot on the price. How many people do you think will come?""
B: ""It started out small but the list keeps growing with all of the aunts, cousins, friends, etc. I also haven't decided if I will invite all of the men in the family as well, or just keep it traditional with the women. Right now I am close to 50 people.""
A: ""50 is a good amount. I think the fancier we make the party, the more it might be better with a professional. Does your husband want guys there? Things can get ""rowdier"" with men there lol.""
B: ""He said we should invite the guys because then we will get more presents haha! I said I don't think it will work that way, because the men coming with their wives are not going to give extra presents. Also, I don't need more things, I am just excited to have everyone I love there to celebrate this new little addition to the crew!""
A: ""I found a professional photographer that is available the date of the shower.  She is reasonably priced too. ""
B: ""Oh great!  That would be super helpful.  I have to think about catering too...""
A: ""I'll send you the details about this photographer and you can tell me if it's a go or not. I don't know anything about catering. What do you think you are going to serve as far as food and drink?""
B: ""I think something simple.  Maybe sandwiches?  or the traditional family style chicken and pasta?  I guess I need to get the guest list in order first to know how many people we will be feeding.  Have you been getting ready for the big 10 mile run coming up?""
A: ""That sounds good, but yeah, you should probably get the guest list first. The run prep has been going great. I'm always running so it's not like I was out of shape for it or anything. Are you still going to start running once you have the baby? It would be good for you.""
B: ""yes.  I've been walking to kick start the weight loss and just to get my self healthier.  Any little bit helps, right?""
A: ""Of course! I've heard that walking is great for pregnant women. Any kind of exercise is good for you!""
B: ""I can build up my workouts too once the baby comes.  Sneak in a free online workout here and there while baby sleeps.  The internet really helps with that!  No need for a gym right away...""
A: ""You know, you could just make yourself a home gym. That way you can easily workout whenever you get the chance!""
B: ""Yes!  I've thought about that too!  I love the way I feel already and its just been a few workouts.  ""
A: ""That's great to hear. I think you'll feel even better once you start running!""
B: ""I should ask for a jogging stroller for a shower gift!  Take baby with me. ""

A: ""Hmm, now that I don't know.  Salem's Lot is a vampire movie and Poltergeist is basically a haunted house type show.  Salem's Lot is really scary but Poltergeist doesn't really get scary until late in the show.""

B: ""I agree, tea has been great for my focus and energy.  I love coffee too, but it makes me too jittery and it's hard to sit still and study when I drink it.  How about you?""
A: ""I think I'm too much of a tea person to bother with coffee. Basically, why waste the time trying some coffee when I could be drinking some Earl Grey?""

A: ""I've been doing research on what running shoes to get and there are so many options I can't choose.""
B: ""Let me see if I can help you narrow your choices down.  What are your criteria? I mean, do you want arch support,  cushioning, things like that.""
A: ""I think that running would give me time to think and compose my music without any distractions.  What do you mean by saying that you feel free?""

A: ""Probably I'm not allowed to go anywhere off my property without them.  I'll have to check out the skechers max and see how they feel.  I'll have someone pick them up for me and try them.  Is there anything else that you can think of that I will need?""
B: ""You'll need some good, thick socks.  You know, I was thinking being free when running. Running could be inspiring for you with your music.""
A: ""I was thinking that too, but I was feeling like it would at least make me feel like I could be alone for a while.  Even if I do have security running with me.  Have you ever tried the toe shoes?  I always wondered if they would be good for running?""
B: ""I tried them briefly.  There's just not enough cushioning and support with them for running in my opinion. They are like being barefoot.""
A: ""OH that wouldn't be good for running in the woods with sticks and stuff.  I will definitely stay away from them.  Thanks for the advise""
B: ""You're welcome!  Hey, when you are out there running maybe you could come up with a rock song just for me?""
A: ""I've started writing a rock song and I'd like to know what you think about it!""
B: ""I'd love to hear it.  What is the song about?""
A: ""It's about a guy that has had his heart broken. It might be too sad though. That's where you come in. Maybe you can give me some better ideas.""
B: ""What about if you make the first part of the song a ballad that laments the heartbreak, but then the second half picks up, gets high-energy and celebrates his freedom and ability to move on and hope for the future.  Sort of like a Bohemian Rhapsody in terms of having very distinct parts.  What do you think of that?""
A: ""That sounds pretty good! You should just write it then! So, how's the training been going for your 10k run in Boston?""
B: ""I'm been getting out regularly and running in the mornings.  I find that I have good ideas in the mornings while I run, which is a bonus.  When do you find your inspiration for writing songs?  Do they just come to you or do you purposefully sit down and crank them out?""
A: ""I think the ideas have to come to me first before I even think about writing anything. Sometimes they come to me in dreams, then I sit down and go from there. You know, one of these days I'd like to get into running. What motivates you to do these long runs? They seem so brutal.""
B: ""You get an endorphin rush after running for a while.  And for whatever reason your body just starts to love being in motion like that.  I also find it very liberating.  It's just me in my head, doing my own thing.  I have limits, though.  As I mentioned, I'm not into marathons.""
A: ""That makes it sound a bit better. Makes me want to go get some shoes and start running. I don't have any running shoes though. What do I look for?""
B: ""Someone at a good shoe store should be able to help you find something that works.  Get support, lightweight.  You can learn more about yourself and what you need if you look at the wear patterns on your soles.  That shows how you run and informs you of what type of support you need.  If you started running, what type of music do you think you'd listen to while you did?  Would you listen to your own music?""
A: ""Hmm, I never thought about what kind of music I would listen to. Maybe I won't listen to any music and some song ideas will come to me. Do you listen to music when you run? Are you allowed to do that in a race?""
B: ""If I'm going on a light run I do sometimes listen to music.  In a race or if I'm training very purposefully I don't.  I don't want to mess with my rhythm and focus.  But sometimes it's nice to lose yourself that way.""

B: ""Nice. That sounds exciting. Is there a season of sorts or does it go year round?""
A: ""There is a swim season, but for me I swim all year round. I also enjoy surfing.""
B: ""Surfing looks wonderful, but it could be to exhausting for me. As much as I like to swim I need to keep my heart rate reasonable. ""
A: ""That's understandable, maybe I could coach you on some techniques to lower swimming exertion.""

B: ""I like a simple acoustic guitar.""

B: ""Exactly. It is so versatile. What kind of music do you like?""
A: ""I really enjoy rock music. ""
B: ""I don't mind some of the softer rock songs. Anything too intense gets my heart pumping too fast.""

A: ""Yeah, thanks for the suggestion! We can learn together then. I hope you get it. The soft rock  you enjoy sounds great on acoustic guitars. ""
B: ""Yes, I think my mom will get it for me since she feels bad for me. I wonder what is a good song to be my first song to learn. Any suggestions?""
A: ""Maybe you could just move a guitar from the store to your house with your mind. Although I suppose that's ethically frowned upon. What era of softer rock? I quite enjoy Bryan Adams.""
B: ""I could definitely do that, but my mom tells me that is stealing. Bryan Adams is pretty good. I think Eric Clapton is a really good guitarist. ""
A: ""He's amazing. So is John Mayer actually. None of his mainstream stuff really showed his guitar talent so much. ""
B: ""John Mayer is amazing! I love the song Slow Dancing in a Burning Room. I listen to that alone in the dark in my room when I am feeling really sad.""
A: ""That song has always reminded me of my ex! Although I suppose that's it's intended purpose. ""
B: ""Yes, I guess so! I unfortunately don't even have an ex. Not a lot of people want to date a weirdo like me. ""
A: ""I think a lot more people than we realize feel that way about their self. Are you sad alone in your room in the dark often? I hope not. You are amazing. Sometimes it's harder to see from the inside, and I find that especially true of the very most amazing people for some reason.""

B: ""Yes, I'd like that. Maybe you can play some songs and impress both our dates haha""
A: ""LOL I can try! Where do you normally go on these blind dates?""
B: ""We usually go to local musical festivals. I just figured if they enjoy it, then at least we'll have something in common""
A: ""That's not a bad idea honestly. Plus there is plenty of people around since these are blind dates and you don't know much about them prior to these dates.""
B: ""Exactly, maybe for our date. We can head to a Rascall Flatts concert""
A: ""I managed to get four tickets for Rascall Flatts at the local arena in two weeks time. Now we just need to arrange the dates!""
B: ""Oh that's great news! do you have any ideas of who you will be asking to go with you yet?""
A: ""Well, it will be me and you and then we have to find some dates to bring! That's the tricky part.""
B: ""do you have any friends who have friends they'd want to set up on a blind date? ""
A: ""I will have to ask around. I am sure someone will be interested, if even just for the free concert tickets. And then we will win them over with our charm and dashing good looks!""
B: ""sounds like a good plan. I can't wait! even if the dates are bad at least we will still have the concert. ""
A: ""Exactly! I noticed that there's a fairground right near the venue, maybe we can go there before the concert to have some fun.""
B: ""that sounds fun. maybe we can go out to eat first too? ""
A: ""Yes, that is a must! What kind of food do you like to eat?""
B: ""mexican, chinese, italian... I'm not too picky honestly""
A: ""Ooh I love Mexican...actually I think there's a nice restaurant nearby. Tacos and margaritas before the concert? ""
B: ""that sounds wonderful. hopefully the dates agree""
A: ""Good news I found two sisters who said they will go to the concert with us!""
B: ""That's awesome.  How do you know these two sisters?""
A: ""On Reddit, if you can believe it! I was looking at Rascal Flatts fan posts and someone mentioned they couldn't get tickets and were disappointed, so I reached out. Lucky, huh?""
B: ""Yes, that's the power of the internet, I guess.  Are they twins by any chance?  Are we going to be able to tell them apart?""
A: ""Haha, not twins, I don't think. One of them is in college and one isn't, so I assumed they are at least a couple years apart. The younger one is studying music!""
B: ""Do you still want to try to get something to eat before the concert?  Or go to the fairgrounds?  It might be nice to get to know the ladies a bit before we get to the concert, though I'm not sure what their expectations are.""
A: ""Yeah, that would be a good idea. Mexican food! I didn't specify it was going to be like a date or anything, so I don't know their expectations either. We can get a sense of that over burritos first.""
B: ""Yes, I always find that burritos are a way to a girl's heart!  This is so exciting!  I'll have to pay you back some way for setting this all up.""
A: ""It'll all even out in the end, don't worry about it. I know you don't love Rascal Flatts so you are really doing me a favor, to be honest!""
B: ""Well, I think I should at least pay for the burritos.  I just got paid by the gas station so I've currently got some extra cash.  It might even make me look that much more impressive with the sisters!""

B: ""Thanks for asking! They're okay now, but I decided not to apply for the position. I'm thinking about trying to do some work online instead.""
A: ""That sounds like it might be a better option. What kind of work would you do online?""
B: ""I heard about how you can do things like online surveys or typing things out. I'm not a fast typer but it's less strenuous than cleaning, that's for sure. Do you think it's a good idea for somebody like me?""
A: ""I don't know much about it but it sounds like it might be less stressful than cleaning. Maybe do some looking around online to see what you can find out.""
B: ""Maybe if I do it, I'll ask your advice about investing in crypto like you mentioned. I worry it's just a fad, and I'm not getting any younger, so I need to be thinking about retirement savings.""
A: ""Yeah, none of us are getting any younger! I'm looking to get a new job myself. I'm sick of working at home as a vet.""

A: ""I would have to say Hugh Jackman he was such i nice guy. I was a stunt double for the greatest showman. ""

B: ""What do you do? I'm work for a watch dealer.""
A: ""No wonder you like watches! I'm a commercial electrician""

B: ""Not like that! I just have a rear view camera. And it beeps when I get to close to things, which is nice. Cars are getting so advanced. I am feeling left behind""

A: ""Not very far - a few hours - but I guess any distance at all seems like a big one to me!""
B: ""Yeah, I can see that. But as long as you can still drive to see them, I think you will be fine. When are you starting school?""
A: ""In September, if all goes to plan. But enough about me. How are the horses?""
B: ""They are great! I love spending time in a barn. We recently purchased a new stalion. His name is Macho.""
A: ""That's a great name for a horse! How many do you have altogether now?""
B: ""Right now we have 3 horses and a donkey.  You would love them.  You need to visit sometimes.  Being around horses is so destressing.""

A: ""How much does a PI cost these days? It's got to be less than the pony you just bought, right?""
B: ""First off he is not a pony he is a stallion. PIs are about the same as they were five years ago when I last hired one for a different issue. They are more expensive in NYC in general, but that's like anything in the city. Have you budgeted that into your move to the city for college?""
A: ""My apologies to you and Macho the stallion. I'll be getting a stipend, if that's not enough, luckily, I like instant noodles.""

B: ""That would be a good idea.  Have you had any luck yet? any prospects?""
A: ""Yeah there is so far two that are interested so i'm trying to look for something that we can all fit in. How is your new stallion, is he getting on with the other 3 horses you have? ""
B: ""Yes, although he can be a bit temperamental at times.  He really likes my wife though.  ""
A: ""Oh he probably just needs some more time. Stallions have a crazier temperament than females horses. But at least he has taken a liking to your wife. ""
B: ""Yes, whenever he sees the donkey following her he tries to chase it away. I think he's jealous!  Are you going to take your car to the city?  That can probably get expensive too, I imagine.""
A: ""Yeah that mostly is a case of jealously especially if your donkey is male also. And no im going to leave my car at my parents the city is too busy easier to catch the train everywhere. ""
B: ""That makes sense.  Keeps you from having to find a nearby parking garage and having to put up with that expense as well.  ""
A: ""Exactly i do not want to deal with that on top of everything else. I am hoping to also get something close to the school that way i don't ever really have to travel far. I will be too busy with school work for any leisure anyway. ""

B: ""Yes - you will need to clean out the bunny pens, feed them, and spend time petting the bunnies. It's quite easy, even I can manage it and I'm so clumsy! Does that sound okay?""
A: ""Yes it is perfect, also do I need to special clothing ? I imagine that place must be a little bit dirty.""
B: ""You don't need any special clothing. I just wear normal everyday clothes. Don't wear anything too nice because you'll probably get bunny droppings on them!""
A: ""That is what I thought. Do I need to bring my lunch or there are restaurants in the area ?""
B: ""I'd recommend bringing your own lunch or at least a few snacks. They don't provide food there unless you want to eat carrots! Have you ever worked in a pet shelter before?""
A: ""Never, I never had a pet also, it that a problem ?""
B: ""It shouldn't be a problem - they let me volunteer even though I've never had a bunny as a pet before. You don't need experience, you just need to love animals!""

A: ""That is a great idea! I wonder how much would you sell honey for at a local farmer's market? ""
B: ""Hm, I guess that depends on the quality! Maybe I should get the honey tested to make sure it's good quality. Have you ever thought about performing one of your songs at a farmer's market?""
A: ""I never even knew that was an option! You could also use the excess honey to cook with. You could experiment with papaya and honey and make face masks as well. I hear both are good for your skin.""
B: ""I could use a nice face mask after gorging on seafood. Had any good lobster lately?""
A: ""Yes, actually I have! I had lobster tail last week. It was delicious. The hardest part of making the papaya honey face mask for you would be not eating the papaya! Haha. I know how much you like it.""

B: ""I bet a ginger honey glaze would work well with grilled shrimp, with some veggies on the side. thanks for the idea!""
A: ""Now, I am hungry haha! No problem! Thank you for the idea to sing my songs at a local farmer's market. I am definitely going to look into that.""

B: ""I can understand. The first few steps are always the hardest. And you have already taken them. So it should get easier from here. I am sure your parents will come around and support you. When do you plan to show it to them?""
A: ""Once I finish arranging it. I'm not sure if I should play it for them on the piano or on the guitar. What do you think?""
B: ""Great idea. Since I am into music I would be willing to help you with the music part of it. Do let me know if you need help or need another ear to hear the final product.""
A: ""That would be a good idea!  I'm sort of stuck on a bridge for the song too. I'm not sure if maybe it should be an instrumental bridge or a bridge with lyrics.""

A: ""I would be scared to have a robot in my bedroom too. Does it smell funny?""

B: ""Awesome. I'm cooking some burgers on the grill. Cheeseburgers are my fave""
A: ""I love a good burger, but I try hard to stay thin and in shape.""
B: ""I am all about fitness. I used to be a gym teacher""
A: ""Did you have a special uniform? I love my skinny jeans and leggings.""
B: ""Just loose fitting clothing. That's about it""
A: ""I like band shirts, especially with ruffled sleeves.""
B: ""I was too poor to afford anything really growing up""
A: ""Is life better for you now?""
B: ""Yes. I serve food to the poor because of what I went through""
A: ""Truly that is a great way to give back. I admire you.""
B: ""Thank you so much. It is always great to volunteer for a cause.""
A: ""I saw a documentary on World War 2 and I am very sure you would like it. Have you seen it?""
B: ""Which documentary are you taking about? I have seen all kinds of them!""
A: ""World War 2 in Colour. It is a Netflix documentary. It shows a lot of historic footage that's been restored in color and shown in high definition!""
B: ""That sounds cool. I'll have to put it on the list. What have you been up to lately?""
A: ""I've been hunting for some fitness clothing deals online. Since the weather is getting warmer, I thought I would stock up on some clothes so that I can be out and about but be comfortable!""
B: ""I hear ya! I need to dig out some clothes. I stashed all the summer stuff away. Are you finding any good deals?""
A: ""Yeah, some! I specifically look for second hand clothing because I want to be environmentally conscious, and there are some good deals on clothing that people only wear once or twice and want to get rid of!""
B: ""This is true. Waste not want no I always say. I'm just glad the sun feels warm on my face again. Got any big fitness plans for the summer?""
A: ""I'm definitely planning on training for a marathon this summer. It's been in my bucket list for a while, and I want to start now.""
B: ""Nice. I may need to set some goals like that. It's been a while since I have felt motivated. A change in seasons helps though.""
A: ""Would you consider joining me on my marathon training? The regimen also can be tweaked for shorter distances!""
B: ""I would like to but I don't want to slow you down! How far do you run to train on avreage? ""
A: ""I have been reading about a programme that trains people for longer distance running. Sounds like something you might like?""
B: ""Possibly, but running isn't on my mind right now. I broke my ankle 4 days ago :(""
A: ""wow!  How did that happen?""
B: ""I caught my foot in a hole in the front yard and went down. So now I'm in a boot and have to take it easy for a month or so""

B: ""Yeah, at least I can work on my upper body still, that's no problem :) The running just has to wait a bit is all""

B: ""Oh wow that's a great idea! I think that would be awesome, I've never tried that before.""
A: ""How has your ankle been feeling? By the way, did you get a cheeseburger?""
B: ""My ankle is not great - it's going to be a while before I can walk again, let alone run. Believe me, I have been eating cheeseburgers all week! It's my comfort food!""
A: ""Well try not to get too out of shape whilst you are bed bound and eating cheeseburgers. ""
B: ""You're right, I really want to stay fit. It's just so hard to motivate myself, especially when I can't even exercise at the moment, so it feels almost pointless to eat healthy food!""
A: ""But you don’t have to eat unhealthy cheeseburgers. They have plant based burgers that taste even better than beef and are healthy too!""
B: ""Maybe I will try them - what sort would you recommend? Do you make your own burgers?""
A: ""No I don’t make them per se, they can be bought at the grocery store either in preformed patties or not. There are several brands but I prefer Light Life.""
B: ""If only I could walk to the grocery store, I would look for some. I'll try when my ankle has healed. Unless you want to bring me some?""
A: ""Well, I guess I could do that but first I want to figure out if you have any food allergies to soy or bioflavonoids or anything really. I don’t want to bring you an allergic reaction along with your lunch!""
B: ""Don't worry about that - I've never reacted to anything so I'm pretty sure I don't have any allergies!""
A: ""Ok well what would you like to have with the plant based burgers. Some type of salad or what?""
B: ""Salad would be amazing! But honestly, whatever you think! I know you are the expert on healthy eating. Thanks so much for doing this for me!""

A: ""Not really. It's so expensive trying to find dog sitters around where I am! I would like to go somewhere with nice, warm, sandy beaches... any recommendations?""
B: ""Definitely Florida, then. Next time I go I think you'd get a kick out of it! I love sitting on the beach and reading ""
A: ""Me too! I also like to make beach bonfires. Is that allowed on beaches in Florida?""

B: ""A glass of wine? That would be a great topper to the whole proceedings!""

B: ""My 3 cats are cheese crazy, they all seem to like cheddar for some reason! ""
A: ""Haha, perhaps cats and dogs have more in common than anyone previously thought, seems they're both fond of a bit of cheddar.""
B: ""I think so, everyone loves it. But I like eating havarti with my wine, or even Muenster :)""

B: ""Yes, our local cheese shop had it. It is so good! What kind of cheese do you like to drink with your wine?""

B: ""I like to walk in parks for good health. No soft drinks for me either!""
A: ""I love soft drinks when I study computer programming. I wish I could cut it off.""
B: ""I love sodas with my burgers and fries but I m trying to watch sugar intake""

B: ""Sodas in us made with high fructose corn syrup. Bad for you!""

A: ""Have you been lowering your sugar intake?""
B: ""Yeah! I bought a book called how to bake with less sugar, and it's given me lots of good ideas on how to use other sweeteners in my cooking as well.""
A: ""Is the flavor different when you use a different sweetener?""
B: ""I do have to admit, yes. But it's been great to use flavors that I don't mind, such as using honey in my tea or using fruits such as bananas in my smoothies. I end up using white sugar in my cooking because sometimes there's no great substitute, but I only use a small pinch.""
A: ""I tried switching to diet soft drinks but I didn't enjoy the taste. Maybe I'll try eating more fruits to satisfy my sweet tooth instead fo grabbing another soft drink.""
B: ""I think that's a great idea. Eating more fruits has definitely helped feel fuller too, so I've been able to watch my calories more easily too.""
A: ""It's always good to drop a few pounds so you can show off when the weather gets warm""
B: ""Yes. The elusive six pack may in the works as well. We will see!""
A: ""Keep me posted. Coaching swimming keeps me in shape.""
B: ""Does the pool that you use for coaching have public swimming hours? I would love to swim to help my fitness level!""

B: ""I see. Yeah I don't want to be swimming when it's crowded with families and teenagers! Yuck!""
A: ""I just came in from coaching swimming and the pool today was not crowded at all; I thought of you.""

B: ""Yeah, the cat's sitting right beside me as we speak. His name is Chester. Chester The Mouse Molester lol he likes to slap around the mice before he finishes them off""
A: ""That's a great name! Chester sounds like he would be very entertaining. Have you walked him on a leash?""
B: ""He's not terribly keen on that, we tried it a few times and you'd think he'd die. Jumping up in the air and all haha""
A: ""I would keep trying. I've always wanted to walk a cat on a leash. It turns heads.""
B: ""Yeah it's fun to do, but I don't think Chester is one who appreciates it a whole lot. He likes just laying around the house""
A: ""Ahh, to have a cat's life. Just laying around on a sunny spot. Then once in a while do some terrorizing. ""
B: ""Cats are pretty lucky, treated like gods lol just like my boyfriend""
A: ""Well, after our conversation, I went to my neighbor's house and offered to walk their cat on a leash. The cat was not very happy. It didn't go well.""
B: ""Oh no! I usually have so much fun with it. Maybe you can walk Chester some time!""
A: ""Yeah, i would give it a try! I think my leash was too short. My neighbor's cat tried to jump at a bird and almost strangled itself.""
B: ""Haha okay, that must have been it. I'm guessing it was a short walk?""
A: ""Yeah, and part drag! lol How come your boyfriend didn't take you with him on his photoshoot?  I bet Cozumel would have been romantic!""
B: ""I know I should have gone with him! I'm busy taking care of Chester, though, which has not been very glamorous. How has the swim coaching been going?""
A: ""Pretty good, for the most part. A few of my swimmers need leashes themselves.  They keep forgetting to see how close they are to the end of the pool and hitting their heads.""
B: ""Oh okay, yeah that's a rookie mistake! They probably don't pay you enough. Now, do you study programming before or after swim practice? Or during?""
A: ""Usually after. It helps me unwind. I'm afraid to do it during.  Somebody might drown!""
B: ""Yeah, that makes a lot of sense! I like to take walks in parks to unwind, personally.""
A: ""You should go with your boyfriend on his next photo shoot. I bet that would help you undwind! I could watch Chester for you. Maybe even teach him to swim.""

A: ""You definitely don't want a breed that could get aggressive or that requires a considerable amount of training.  I find that golden retrievers, labs, and boxers are excellent companions.  I guess the other thing to think about is the size of the dog...would you want a smaller or more medium/large breed?""
B: ""I would want one to keep in the house so it doesn't need to shed much.  I like the idea of a smaller dog but somewhat manly?  Andy idea of dogs based on that?""
A: ""Hmm.  The smaller you go, the less ""manly"" the dog becomes, I think lol.  Daschunds are cute...so are beagles...but beagles tend to howl.""
B: ""I wouldn't mind a beagle I guess.  Have you ever owned one?  ""
A: ""I personally have not, but my grandmother did.  She let the poor thing get drastically overweight.  The beagle did howl quite a bit, which was a bit much to deal with at times...but she also didn't train him to not howl as much, so maybe that could be something you work on with the dog.""
B: ""Well, I also live in a rural area, so the howling might not be as big of a deal.  I know you work.  I do too.  What do you do with your dogs while you are working?""
A: ""I crate-trained the dogs early on, so when it is time for me to go to work, they head into their crate (it's quite large) and they stay in there until I get home.  Lucky for me, I work close to home, so I usually stop home for lunch, let the dogs out a bit to play and stretch, and then they go back in the crates until I'm done with work for the day.  Some people I know send their dogs to a doggie daycare.""
B: ""Well, my job is boring.   But my boss might not care if I bring my dog to work with me.  He has a bird.  I would just have to work on the howling.  Did you train your dogs yourself or did you send them to obedience training?""
A: ""You never told me what you do for work?  You mentioned it was boring... have you ever thought about doing something else?  ""

A: ""I def. have felt that way before. It does get better. It just takes time. If you feel like this is a really big rut, maybe reach out and get some help and start transitioning to get a new job. Have you loooked at any job openings in your area?""
B: ""It's more than the endless toil of work. It is my wife. Well I should really get used to saying ex-wife, because that is what she is. It is hard to accept. Maybe I will start a Smiths cover band to get my feelings out.""

B: ""Thank you, that's really kind of you. I think a dog would really help me. What breed are your dogs? I'm thinking of getting a small one.""
A: ""Maybe a dog won’t help your depression after all. I mean if you are really depressed having a dog might make you feel worse.""
B: ""I'm honestly ready to try anything. A dog would give me a responsibility and get me out of the house for walks. I won't know until I try - but I like the idea of spending time with your dogs first to see how I get on.""
A: ""I am a little concerned for their safety living with a depressed person what If you forget to feed them or let them outside to use the bathroom?""
B: ""You have a point, but I don't think I would forget to feed them or let them out. I think they would give me a reason to get moving. What kind of dog would you recommend for me? ""
A: ""Hmmmm… it really all depends. I guess I would say a mutt. A rescue animal that no one else would think twice about adopting. That way you know that only you are capable of being the mutt’s owner. ""
B: ""That's a good way of looking at it. I'm worried about adopting a rescue animal though - is there a chance they could be aggressive?""
A: ""Yes, but there’s also a chance they could kick field goals in the NFL like that one Disney movie. Life is about chances if the dog bites you when you pet it the first time, It’s too aggressive.""
B: ""Haha, I like the attitude. I guess if my dog did turn out to be aggressive, I could get you to help me train it? ""

B: ""Is it a high ride? You already know I am afraid of heights.""
A: ""No, it is in the dark and not a high ride. Splash Mountain is higher for sure. What is favorite thing to eat while you are at Disney?""
B: ""Corn dogs are my favorite. They are hard to get where I live so I am going to eat a ton of them when I am there. Do you have a favorite Disney snack?""
A: ""The corndogs are great! I love the churros. I will eat a few a day when I am there. ""
B: ""I forgot about churros. Now I don't know what to eat! I didn't realize Splash Mountain was high. Now I don't know what rides to go on. Maybe if I close my eyes! ""
A: ""You could have a corndog first and churro for dessert! I suggest that you go on the rides regardless if they are high or not. Trust me, they will all be worth it. ""
B: ""That's a great idea! Does your sister have a favorite ride?""

A: ""Yum! I love corn dogs!  Hey! We should go to Disneyland together!  You are a lot nicer than my sister. Maybe you'd rub off on her!  She'd like you because she likes to sing and dance all the time.  ""
B: ""Awesome! I would love to come with you guys. But i should warn you i will be Anna in the frozen world.""
A: ""She'll probably try to insist there are two Anna's.  She's pretty stubborn.  And don't tell her I said so, but when she dances she sort looks like an old crow flapping it's wings.  Sings like one too!""

B: ""Not yet. I feel a bit nervous. Do you think I should go for it? How can I motivate myself?""
A: ""You should go for it! There's a good book you could read, called Calling in The One. And you could also try looking up how to write a dating profile that stands out on google. Have you used any of the apps before?""
B: ""No. Do you have any suggestion as to which one I should start with? I don't want girls to think I'm just looking for casual sex, if you know what I mean..""

A: ""Hey, how are you? I was just daydreaming about my favorite car.""
B: ""I'm good. Just came back from mountain biking.""
A: ""I rode a bike to work today, speaking of which want to buy a watch?""
B: ""Not really. I'd buy a cup of coffee though.""
A: ""I should have been a barista... My dad makes fun of my career choice all the time.""
B: ""Do you sell watches?""
A: ""I do. But I spend all my paychecks on more watches. And shoes.""
B: ""Interesting job. Do you drink?""
A: ""I subside entirely on royal crown cola.""
B: ""That is funny. My favorite drink is a cup of coffee""
A: ""If I collect enough empty cans I can sell them for a rolls royce.""
B: ""That would be a lot of cans.""
A: ""It isn't like I have it any other way, I'm paid entirely in broken watches.""
B: ""I don't understand that. How are you paid in broken watches?""
A: ""Have you been mountain biking anywhere interesting lately?""
B: ""Yes, actually. I went to a nearby trail and spent a few hours biking! It was so much fun! What is your favorite pair of shoe you own?""
A: ""I have two brands of shoes that I tend to prefer. Jack Wolfskin and Oboz for their trail running shoes. They're a cross between a hiking boot and a running shoe. Super comfortable, waterproof, and durable.""
B: ""Wow, interesting. I'll definitely have to check those out! Have you thought about getting a car so you don't have to bike to work or do you enjoy riding?""
A: ""I have thought about it but I'm not sure it would pay off with savings in the end. I like vintage cars a lot. Do you mean vintage or modern cars? ""
B: ""I didn't have a specific type in mind. Wow, I really enjoy vintage cars too...preferably Chevy Trucks, like the 51' Apache or the 71' Chevy C10 Sidestep! Those are beautiful pieces of American made trucks!""
A: ""I want a classic Ford, myself. I tend to be a Ford person, not a Chevy one. Either a '57-67 old truck, or a '67 Ford Mustang GT. I prefer cars that I can fix, today's are too computerized. I'm not sure buying one would pay off with work 2 blocks away. ""
B: ""You're so right about that, they make things to wear out faster and price things to high these days. I can see why now riding your bike is much more efficient! How convenient to be that close to you job! Guess what I did today? I went and tried out one of Starbucks Cinnamon Roll Frappuccino...it was fantastic! But I think their White Iced Mocha Frappuccino is my favorite! ""
A: ""That sounds fantastic! I love Starbucks but don't get it very often because it can be expensive. I love their Frappuccino's the most. I'll have to try the Cinnamon Roll one! I wonder if they have it at the shop near my home. Do you have other things you like there? ""
B: ""Oh yes, I love just about everything including their food selections. They have fantastic breakfast, they have a bacon gouda and egg sandwich that is just melts in your mouth! I tend to go to Starbucks to treat myself once every couple weeks. You're right it can be expensive. I am a nifty shopper and try to find coupons or discounts online before going. I meant to ask you, what kind of watches do you sell?""
A: ""I usually buy gift cards when they're having bonus ones during the holiday season. Sometimes you can get $240 worth of gift cards there for $200 and such. I'm not as huge of a fan of their food, but I love trying all their drinks. I think the Refreshers are my favorite thing, along with the Cold Brew and the Frappuccinos. The new Kiwifruit/Starfruit Refresher is my new favorite. The Mango/Dragonfruit is a second.  ""
B: ""I have seen the Mango/Dragonfruit but I haven't tried it. I have however, had the Kiwifruit/Starfruit Refresher it was pretty delicious! When Summertime comes I'll be interested in trying out the different refreshers.  I get in on those deals too, with the gift cards! I love free money!  I like gifting to friends and family too, they get excited when I share my good fortunes with them!""
A: ""I have a buddy that has a classic Ford for sale; it looks like a good deal; I might buy it""
B: ""It sounds exactly like what you were looking for! Will you need to do a lot of work to fix it up?""
A: ""Yeah it needs a bit, but thats the fun of it.""
B: ""Will you drive that to work instead of riding your bike?""
A: ""With the way people drive around here, probably not. It will be my fun ride. Plus the more i save riding my bike, the more i can put into the car!""
B: ""That's a smart idea! I bet you could negotiate with them to buy the car for a lower price since it will need some repairs. I always try to haggle on prices!""
A: ""Yeah, wont have to haggle to much, he is a buddy, pretty much giving it to me at cost. Hey have you had the chance yet to try the kiwifruit refresher?""
B: ""I went yesterday to try it, and you were right that it is delicious! Do you have any other drink recommendations I can try?""
A: ""No, ive just been gettin that after a long bike ride. It really is great!""
B: ""Where do you like to go when you ride your bike? Do you go on paved roads or more remote trails?""
A: ""Mostly its just paved when i have to run errands, when i do have free time i love to ride the trails at the park.""
B: ""That sounds fun! I mostly ride my mountain bike on hiking trails. I like to check out difficult trails deep in the wilderness.""
A: ""Do you go mountain biking on your own or do you go in a group?""
B: ""I usually go alone, but I've done it with a group before too.  There's pros and cons to both.  How about you? Do you typically ride the trails along?""
A: ""It depends on the day, I have a few friends that like to ride so they go with me quite a bit. I am also part of a cycling club and we all ride together once a week.""
B: ""Yeah that sounds a lot like me.  I like being part of a community, but there's also something very freeing about being out in the wilderness all alone.""
A: ""Do you wear any type of device that allows people to track your location for safety? I'd be scared being too far out in the wilderness all alone""
B: ""I'll typically have my cell phone with me, but otherwise I don't do anything special.  You'd be surprised how well your body will keep track of things like your heading and the distance you've traveled once you've practiced a little bit.""
A: ""I will take your word for it! Have you tried any new drinks at Starbucks lately?""
B: ""Yeah I tried the Iced Pineapple Matcha last week and it was amazing!  Still haven't gotten to try the Kiwi Starfruit Refresher, but maybe next time!  Have you ever tried the pineapple macha?""
A: ""I haven't, it sounds really interesting. I will add it to my list of drinks to try! The Kiwi Starfruit Refresher is still my favorite, you won't be disappointed.""
B: ""I'll be sure to try it soon!  It's been so hot out lately that it sounds delicious right now actually.  Have you still been biking to work?""
A: ""Yes, I have to take advantage of the nicer weather since I can't ride my bike to work in the winter. It helps me to feel like I've accomplished something first thing in the morning.""

I like that people are so complicated from their wide range of interests and simple in how they feel about their interests. I'm addicted to people. So, yes, I am definitely seeing multiple people still. Thank you for asking.""
A: ""Do you have any business partners in your dog-walking / fertilizer selling businesses?""
B: ""My business partners are the dogs that I walk. I contribute a part of my income from that business to the parents of those dogs. This way they can afford food, healthcare and the occasional toy because they are so nice and good.""
A: ""That's an interesting strategy. I didn't even know most people knew who the parents of their dogs are.""
B: ""The parents are the humans who take care of them. I'm sorry for not clarifying this for you earlier. I love these dogs. They are so smart. ""
A: ""Oh, OK. I though you meant literal biological parents. Have you ever gone for a walk with them and forgotten or run out of waste bags?""
B: ""Sometime I do forget, but in moments like that, I just move the fertilizer toward the grass area. This way the fertilizer can help nearby plants.""
A: ""I was inspired by your dog-waking job and put some flyers up in my neighborhood to start my own business.""
B: ""You will be great at it, especially since you enjoy walking! Start a social media page too to get the word out.""
A: ""Good idea! Maybe I can expand to taking care of people's horses one day, too. That would be amazing!""
B: ""For sure! I bet that would pay even better than dog walking too.""

B: ""What kind of business is it? Have you developed a business plan yet?""
A: ""its a animal grooming business for dogs mainly, maybe you could recommend it to your owners of the dogs you walk?""
B: ""Sure, but you need to plan it out carefully *before* you start it. Too many businesses fail because the folks who start them run into unanticipated complications. You can't anticipate everything, but you'd be surprised how much you can....""

A: ""Be as detailed as you can be about your interest(s) in the field. They want dedicated people, because the work is difficult and stressful on the body and mind.""
B: ""Okay, I can certainly make sure that I'm detailed.  Thinking about my app, I'm worried about seeming wishy-washy and wish I'd been on a more consistent path since I was younger.""
A: ""Your personal history is important, but not as important as you might think in EMT work. What are you concerned about?""
B: ""I feel like my work experience doesn't really show much interest in the medical field.  Like, I've really loved being in the orchestra but I feel like it doesn't help me break into the medical field at all.""
A: ""Ah, no, that's not an issue. They want live, dedicated individuals...""
B: ""Okay, thank you, I know you're the expert here so I will stop worrying so much!  I'll just stay optimistic and try to present myself with enthusiasm.""
A: ""The good folks who hire EMTs want people who are deeply interested in the work and who will be trainable and sustainable. You'll know pretty quickly whether or not you're cut out for the work. So don't worry about it. Apply and follow through. That's my professional advice.""
B: ""Sounds good, maybe if you get this job at the clinic I'll be able to find work their too.  It would be awesome to know someone at work before as I'm getting started.""
A: ""Probably not. You're going to be busier than you've ever been before as an EMT. And I suspect you'll love the work. If you have any doubts going forward, confide in me, and I'll give you my best advice...""
B: ""Sage advice for sure.  What's next for you if you don't get the clinic job? Still considering your own practice?""

B: ""They are very good and enjoying the warm weather, I like to read history as well but never visited Europe, what part of USA do you live?""
A: ""I live in the west coast with near to pacific ocean, you should start thinking of travelling more to explore the world like Columbus.""

A: ""I would say to visit the Italy and Rome as it has a lot of history associated to it and you will enjoy.""
B: ""That is amazing as I always liked the Roman Empire and imagined how the structures are built.""
A: ""I booked a cruise in the next few months. ""
B: ""Where are you planning on going? I'd love to go to Europe!""
A: ""Well actually, I booked a European cruise. It is going to be so amazing. We are traveling through the Mediterranean Ocean and making several port stops. ""
B: ""That sounds wonderful. I think you will get your fill of fish while your traveling.""
A: ""I really hope so, I have heard they have some of the best fish in the world. Hey so, how are your horses doing?""
B: ""They are all pretty happy. They are out grazing in the field right now. They get pretty frisky this time of day and need space to gallop around.""
A: ""That makes sense but, letting them out to pasture is truly the best thing for them. Do plan on taking them riding anytime soon?""
B: ""I like to go near dusk and watch the sun set with my favorite horse. He looks for me every day when it's near that time like clock work.""

A: ""Does it have ever been in a real race ?""
B: ""Yes, a while ago! He didn't win unfortunately but came a good third""
A: ""How do you train a horse to race ?""
B: ""Well it needs to be the right kind of breed to start with, like from a line of race horses. And then you do lots of training with it to keep it fit and healthy and teach it to run!""
A: ""So training a horse is a full time job, did you train it yourself ?""
B: ""It can be if you want to be really good at it! I did but my family helped a lot too, my parents have always done it.""
A: ""Do you like to train horse for racing ? I don't think I could do it, I would not want to hurt my horses. ""
B: ""I do but I don't think I would like it if I was trying to be the very best at it - I think the horses enjoy a bit of more casual racing but it can get a bit brutal when lots of money is involved.""
A: ""That is the thing that is bothering me horse racing, it is very artificial. Humans never needed horse races for their survival. And it can be dangerous for the horses.  ""

A: ""I was telling the kids at the shelter about your pony and they wanted to ask if you could send a photo I could show them. ""
B: ""Of course. I've got tons of photos with the kids at the children's hospital riding on him. I wonder if the homeless shelter would let me bring the pony over one day.""

B: ""They loved him. They laughed and giggled. Smiles all around... except for one shy little boy who wouldn't come close""
A: ""That's awesome, and yes, I would love to see a photo!""
B: ""I'll send over a few good ones once I'm back at my computer. How old are most of the kids at the shelter where you volunteer?""

B: ""I try to cheer up the kids, but I don't think I make any lasting impressions. Your work seems much more fulfilling.""

A: ""Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. Please let me know if there's anything I can do. Do you know what happened?""
B: ""The necropsy showed that Jericho ate some toxic stuff. Can you distract me by regaling some funny stories from your volunteering?""
A: ""I wish. It's been nothing but depressing stories at the shelter lately. I still love what I do, but times are really hard for everyone. Again, I'm so sorry about Jericho.""
B: ""I'm sure he's enjoying his big open pasture in the sky. I'm sorry the shelter has been just depressing lately. Can I ask why you decided to volunteer with the homeless?""
A: ""My father was actually homeless for a short amount of time, and it really stuck with me when he told me all about it. Just how ignored and invisible he felt, and so I wanted to make sure no one else felt that way.""
B: ""Oh wow, what a personal connection. It must be tough and emotional. You are doing good work. How long have you been volunteering?""
A: ""A few years now. It's definitely been a rollercoaster of emotions but I'd recommend it to anyone! Have you been to the kid's hospital lately?""
B: ""I'm actually going later today. Those kids love ponies. It'll be a good distraction for me. ""
A: ""That's a good idea. Jericho will be watching down happily wherever he is. Did you ever take him with you?""
B: ""No, I didn't take him to the hospital just the mini pony, Tina. I'm happy I won't have that association. Jericho actually hated kids. Have you been horseback riding?""
A: ""I was talking to a friend an hour ago regarding their volunteer experience at a charity they help out for at times, and they told me the funniest thing that ever happened to them at a volunteer event. I think it would help cheer you up, I would be glad to tell you it if you are interested.""
B: ""Please do tell me! This week has been very rough for me.""
A: ""Right, so they were talking to one of the people there, thinking that it was another volunteer. And they managed to spill their drink all over them! Embarrassing, but it turned out that it was actually the chief donor! ""
B: ""Haha, it is funny to see that even the rich and well-connected are capable of embarrassing themselves.  Sometimes when I think about being a lawyer I have this picture of the other lawyers as inhuman, but really they are probably just normal people with a higher paying job.""
A: ""Yes exactly! I think he might have donated a bit more to make up for it though so it was all good. That's definitely true, everyone is human""
B: ""That would have been very nice of him if he did!  That was a wonderful story, and it does cheer me up a bit.  Anything else that's interesting happen to you lately?""
A: ""Ah good! Not so much to be honest, i've just been working really. How about you?""
B: ""I've just been keeping busy with the horses while trying to keep my mind off of the one that recently passed.  Now that it's springtime they're starting to be much more active, which is a nice distraction for me.""
A: ""That's great! How are they doing? Do you get to ride them much?""
B: ""Yeah, I'm lucky to be able to ride them all the time!  The little ones are doing great too, it's so exciting seeing how quickly some of them grow up.  You can come by and visit them anytime if you'd like!""
A: ""I'm glad to hear it! Where are you located?""

A: ""I just got an invitation to sponsor for a charity run""
B: ""That is amazing. I know you were planning on doing something with animals. Did you decide what you are going to do?""
A: ""I would like to organize a fundraiser for rescuing retired race horses. a lot of times once they are past their prime they are put down. I hate to see that happen to them.""
B: ""That makes so much sense. The therapeutic horse farm that my parents work at did a fun run but did it along the horse enclosure so that when the people ran by the horses would run along with the people. It was so cool!""
A: ""That must have been wonderful to grow up around. I love riding horses competitively but I hate the darker side of it. Do you have any tips for raising money? You did so well with your fundraiser.""
B: ""Yeah, that was mostly my parents doing. I wish I could ask them for some tips. I really miss them since they passed away and it has been much harder for me to raise large amount of money.""
A: ""Understandable, How old were you when they passed away?""
B: ""I was in my early twenties so, at least I was able to learn a lot from them. The best thing you can do for your fundraiser is try to do something original but, coming up with the idea is always the most difficult idea. ""
A: ""I am sorry for your loss! Maybe I could bring my horse to the fundraiser, if that is allowed. That should draw some attention!""
B: ""Yeah, that sounds like a great idea! You could even ride the horse around at the fundraiser!""
A: ""Fingers crossed that they would let me do that. If they do, my cousin harper can come ride with me too.""
B: ""That would be amazing both of you on horses would get a lot of attention!""
A: ""Is booking a DJ a good idea for the fundraiser in your experience?""
B: ""Yeah I think its worth the cost. You might be able to find someone to do it for free if they care about the cause too. Music is important to get everyone in a good mood and for people to enjoy themselves. Just putting on the radio or a playlist won't be nearly as good ""
A: ""Ok thanks! Do you have any you would recommend me talking to?""
B: ""There is a guy named Dan who did the last few runs I was on. He was really good, kept the crowd entertained, and seemed to play the perfect music for the situation. I don't know his last name or phone number but I can get it for you from someone else who was at the run. I can help you get sponsorship as well. Get any sponsors for the run yet?""
A: ""Nice! Yes we've had a couple of good ones so far thanks, $1000!""
B: ""Maybe I can bring my dog Harper over when I'm done with work tomorrow and we can go over some ideas. I know how much you love horses and I think you have a great idea to help raise money for them.""
A: ""That sounds great! How is Harper?""
B: ""Harper's been doing great. He's just getting out of his puppy phase. I bring him to the hospital whenever I go and the kids love him, and he loves the attention. ""
A: ""That's wonderful, I suppose they don't get to see many animals being stuck in the hospital?""
B: ""They have a few therapy pets come by each month, but they all seem to like Harper the best. ""
A: ""Must be very satisfying for you! Schnauzers are beautiful dogs""
B: ""I'd bring him to your charity race but I think he might spook the horses, or the horses would spook him. ""

A: ""Lets  go  to  theater to  watch a drama . ""
B: ""Sure. Which drama did you have in mind?""
A: ""Do you want something contemporary, or historic (like Ibsen?) I hear there's a modern remake of ""Of Mice and Men"".""
B: ""No thanks. The movie Soul just came out last year. It's a movie made by Disney and Pixar. That movie is a nice drama around the life a music teacher. He likes playing his piano. I think we might both enjoy this.""
A: ""Is that the one where he dies and goes to a limbo-y, heaven-y type place? It seems a bit lighthearted for a drama.""
B: ""The drama part around this movie lies in the freedom of expression and the valuing of another individuals existence. The music teacher connecting with someone else and the ghost child's journey of self awareness.""
A: ""That does sound a bit dramatic. A bit existential for Pixar, no? All right, I'll go. Maybe we can grab some Mexican beforehad.""
B: ""Let's get rolled tacos and bring them into the theater while they are still warm. Theater food is expensive.""
A: ""I agree that theater food is expensive, but there's no reason not to eat in a restaurant ahead of time.  Plus I'd like, maybe, to eat something harder to bring in the theater, like carnitas.""
B: ""Carnitas are a legit vibe. Let's get extra guacamole with horchata because carbs aren't even a real thing.""
A: ""You certainly don't mean Gucamole WITH horchta...that would be disgusting ... surely you mean, ""guacamole and also get some horchata""  PS I don't like horchata. Too rice-y. But YASS to the extra guacamole!!!""
B: ""That's exactly what I mean. We vibe so well together. ""
A: ""So you teach 5 days a week?""
B: ""I like to think that I teach my entire life. I can teach at the grocery store or in a classroom.""
A: ""But do you get paid for teaching at the grocery store?""
B: ""no, i just get paid teaching in a classroom.""

A: ""I'll have to check it out. Any other music recommendations?""
B: ""Please check out my soundcloud. I make music just like this.""
A: ""Remember the music producer friend I was telling you about, she just offered me 2 passes to a Radiohead concert in our city. I immediately though of you. Interested?""
B: ""Omg yes that would be perfect, it sounds like a lot of fun. Let me know how much to give you for the ticket. And just messages me the details. ""
A: ""Sweet, I'll text you the details later when I get them.  I won't be paying anything for the tickets though, so don't worry about paying me anything for it.  If you want to split parking that would be great though!  Have you ever been to a Radiohead concert?""
B: ""Oh okay that’s great and yes I will definitely help pay for parking. I haven’t been able to see them live yet this is super exciting. ""
A: ""Sounds good, I'm going to really have to start listening to some Radiohead to learn their songs before we go.  Concerts are way more fun when you know the songs.  Maybe I'll start with Creep first?  Any other songs that are must-listens?""
B: ""Yeah me too need to makes sure I have all the lyrics down. Yes start with Creep first and then do the song No surprises that’s another great song. ""
A: ""Okay I'll make sure to check out No Surprises too! I'm pretty excited about this!  Do you have anything else going on this week?""

B: ""That would be awesome! Now the weather's getting better I'm itching to get outside!""
A: ""Agreed! This winter was so long, thankfully its starting to get warm and beautiful outside. I've always wanted to go to the grand canyon but I have never had the chance""
B: ""Me too. It's really been a lifelong dream of mine to go. I need to buy a new pair of hiking shoes first though - my old ones are falling apart.""
A: ""The right pair of shoes makes a world of difference. I used to hike in normal sneakers and by the end of the hike my feet were killing me!""
B: ""Oh god, I can imagine. I need as much ankle support as possible or I slip all over the place and one of these days I'll break them both. The joys of getting older!""
A: ""You and me both. Maybe if we are tired from the hike we can do the donkey rides to bring us back up the canyon!""
B: ""You're full of good ideas today! That sounds awesome. In actual fact let's plan on that, then I know we have something relax to look forward to at the end!""
A: ""I'm glad we are on the same page. I like to hike, but lets be real, i work inside all day. I'm not a mountain climber""
B: ""For sure, and I'm not exactly known for my physical prowess either, ha. Aim for a good view, not a good workout, right?""
A: ""Those are words to live by in my opinion. This sounds like it will be a really fun trip. I cant wait.""
B: ""Me too. We should see if we pass any Corvette and BMW dealerships on the journey there, might as well treat ourselves to a look at some nice wheels!""
A: ""I just checked the weather and found out it is supposed to rain this weekend! I guess my plan to hike a local trail is ruined now. ""
B: ""What do you think you'll do instead?""
A: ""Not sure...maybe I will get some work done around the house. Do you have any upcoming hikes planned aside from the Grand Canyon?""

A: ""Have you gotten your new hiking boots yet?""
B: ""No I haven't just been looking through some shops for possible replacement boots. Just get sucked in to reading reviews. Back when I would buy shoes in store things would be much faster!""

A: ""That is what I'm hoping.  I just hope my parents get over being upset with me.  I'm here because my friend took us for a drive in his step mothers car without asking.  She reported it stolen and I hope they understand it wasn't my fault. But, I'm dreaming of pizza.  lol""

A: ""That's sounds great.  My mouth is watering.  Do you feed your dogs pizza while you eat?""

A: ""That's nice of the restaurant.  Is The Big Slice of Cheese a chain restaurant or just a single location?""
B: ""I've never seen another one around, so I think it is just a single location.  How is your time in juvi going?""

A: ""This will be my first time seeing the Stones in person, actually.  Take a guess which song is my favorite.""
B: ""I wonder if it's ""Gimme Shelter""? You know that's my favourite.""
A: ""Holy moly, you got it!  That's an amazing song.  I also like ""Sympathy for the Devil"" and ""Paint it Black,"" among others.  But ""Gimme Shelter"" is the Stone's best, I think.""
B: ""My favourite Springsteen song is ""Dancing in the Dark"". How about you?""
A: ""You know, I've been listening to a lot of the Boss recently, too.  With the Stones I originally loved ""Angie"" and then after you told me about ""Gimme Shelter"" I went back and listened to more of their stuff and my preference changed to ""Gimme Shelter.""  But with the Boss it's always the same for me: ""I'm on Fire.""  But honestly there's barely a bad Springsteen song, and ""Dancing in the Dark"" is great.""
B: ""By coincidence, I didn't used to like Springsteen, but he's grown on me since you mentioned you had seen him live and how good he was. ""
A: ""He's a poet, I think.  One of the great American storytellers.  I'm glad you've come to appreciate him more!""
B: ""Maybe he will win the Nobel Prize for literature one day, like Bob Dylan!""
A: ""Yes, I really think he could.  Do you like Dylan?  I really like Bob Dylan, too.  I suppose one could dislike his voice, but not his music or lyrics.""

A: ""Hi there, did you know I am super high maintenance?""
B: ""Well considering I do not know you? No, but I am too""
A: ""Well yeah, I love to go around spending money everywhere""
B: ""I spend the most money, on hair care products honestly, my favorite""
A: ""I don not really spend it on hair, I spend it on tanning beds""
B: ""I really want to try that once, I heard its bad for you""
A: ""Yeah I listen to brittney spears while tanning.""
B: ""Go figure. What do you do for fun""
A: ""Spend cash, go shopping, drink smoothies""
B: ""Ha, wow, sounds pretty irresponsible.""
A: ""No it is totally cool, haters going to hate""
B: ""Not really, I am all for it. After you do what your supposed to""
A: ""Yeah you bet, what do you like to do for fun?""
B: ""I play a lot of video games, especially the xbox""
A: ""Wow, you must be super popular like my boyfriend""
B: ""Video games do not make any one popular, more the opposite""
A: ""Tanning beds actually aren't bad for you if you don't overuse them. If you use them a moderate amount, you can actually protect yourself from being burned by the sun.""
B: ""Do you know a specific brand or a specific salon that is guaranteed super safe and effective? I would like to try it. Ohh and a smoothie sounds good after all those pampering!""
A: ""The one on 5th avenue is great ! There is also a smoothie bar nearby. What is your favorite flavor ?""
B: ""I love strawberry and banana! Have you been to a Britney Spears concert?? I don't really like crowds, I would rather stay in and play xbox! But I think experiencing a concert is gonna be awesome!""
A: ""Britney will come here in 4 months, I already bought my ticket, you should too if you want to go, they will be sold out soon. ""
B: ""Maybe its hard not to go if I'm with somebody. Do you mind if I tag along with you?""
A: ""No, I would like you to come with me. It will be fun. We could have matching hairstyles, do you have any idea ?""
B: ""Sure! That's great. Do you have a boyfriend? We can double date! For the hairstyle we can go for the classic 90s look updo! ""
A: ""No I don't have a boyfriend, I broke up with him, he did not like to spend money. ""
B: ""Ahh thats ok! We can go by ourselves! Enjoy the evening with our matching hairstyles! I'm excited!""
A: ""Yeah, but you should buy a ticket a soon as possible. Do you have enough money ? The tickets  are quite expensive.""
B: ""Yeah I have enough money! I work a lot because I spend a lot. What kind of tickets did you get so I can buy the same""
A: ""Have you found tickets to the concert?""
B: ""No, not yet. I am having trouble finding free time since I work so much. When's the Britney Spears concert?""
A: ""I know you work so much! Its not for another 3 months so hopefully you can find the time.""
B: ""I'm sure I'll be able to take off work with 3 months notice. Maybe I'll try a tanning bed before the concert so I can look extra good""
A: ""Well if you need help picking out a good place or what to try, you know im somewhat of an expert haha""
B: ""Yes absolutely! How much does a session usually cost? And will I need more than one session to get the desired effect?""
A: ""Usually you want your first time to be your base. The place i go to regulary is like 30 bucks""
B: ""Oh that's not too bad! Especially since I spend a lot of money as it is- just a small expense. Cool! Maybe we could go together before the concert!""
A: ""I would love that! It would be great for you to have some time to relax!""
B: ""Awesome! I look forward to it! And I know, I worked 60 hours last week. I love video games but only get to play like once a week.""
A: ""Have you gotten to play anything good recently when you have time?""
B: ""I just got the newest Mortal Kombat game. I'm pretty sure they're making a movie based on the game. Weird, but I will definitely be seeing it!""
A: ""Are you doing your own hair for Brittney's concert? Or will you be pampering yourself at a salon?""
B: ""Oh, I am definitely doing it myself...I'm not trusting anyone else to do my hair when I'm going to be in front of my goddess! ""
A: ""I totally agree! I know you do a great job with your hair. You always look so great, you should tell me some of your secrets. ""
B: ""You know I've been thinking, work has it that Britney is going to begin another residency in Las Vegas. We should so meet up there! (I'll do your hair, lol)""
A: ""That would be so much fun. I would love to go to VEGAS! We could go on the strip, go to the clubs. Lets plan this. Are you going to be able to get off of work, it seems like your always there. ""
B: ""Seriously?!? Screw the job, I'll quit in a heartbeat for Britney!!! She definitely wasn't talking to me when she said ""Work B*$^#""!""
A: ""Maybe we could run into her if she is doing an extended stay in Vegas. I can get on twitter and try to find out where she hangs out when she's in town. Hopefully the rumor about Vegas is true. ""
B: ""When in Vegas, she lives at the villas at the Rio. So, she's right next to like the pool area, OMG...,.I would just freak if I saw her at the pool!""
A: ""So would I. I better start tanning so I look good when I see her. Maybe she will let us go backstage!""
B: ""I want her to take me home with her! (one can dream, right...) Have you ever been to Las Vegas? I used to live there.""
A: ""No I haven't. I heard so much about it. You can show me around everywhere I need to know. I watched the Real World Las Vegas once but thats about it. ""

B: ""Hi. Good. I am just picking out paint for my new apartment with my boyfriend.""
A: ""Sounds like a good way to end the weekend""
B: ""Yeah. He won't go for red even though I love it. What is your favorite color?""
A: ""I like green but red would be nice also""
B: ""Green is okay. Silver is my other favorite.""
A: ""Are you a cat or dog person?""

B: ""Thanks so much for the invite!  We will be there!  How many people will be attending?""
A: ""I'm thinking it'll be around 20 people.  It really depends on who shows up since we are inviting a few more than that who probably won't come.  It's gonna be a blast!""
B: ""The weather will be great too!  Oh this will be fun!  Hey, how are your dog and cat doing?  I haven't asked about them in a while.""
A: ""They've been doing very well!  I just got a new leash for my dog that's longer and more flexible and he loves it when we go on walks!  How has your new apartment been?""
B: ""I love my new apartment!  It gets such great natural light which is fabulous.  However, I am not the best when it comes to decorating, so I'm having a bit of a hard time making the space my own...if that makes sense.  ""
A: ""Yeah, that makes perfect sense to me.  I think that's a common thing with new places.  They look clean and sharp, but also a bit sterile.  It will take some time to make it feel more like a home.""
B: ""I guess it just gives me more of an excuse to shop!  Haha!  How long have you lived in your place?""
A: ""Haha, that's true! We've been here for 5 years now and it's just starting to feel like a home.  I think having pets helps, have you thought about getting a dog or a cat?""
B: ""I actually have been considering getting a cat!  I've always loved cats, and since they can be somewhat independent, I think they would be great for apartment living.  Did you get your cat from a shelter or from a pet store?""
A: ""Okay, I have news.  The guy at work that is really lovely is single and is going to the party.  So, we have an objective, getting him to talk with me.""
B: ""That's awesome! Have you talked to him before? Or only seen him in passing?""
A: ""I've talked to him at work, but only casually. I'm hoping that we can talk more in depth at the party. ""
B: ""Are you both in the same department at work?""
A: ""Thankfully not. Being in the same department would make things messy. I don't actually get to see him that much.""
B: ""I can see that, too much time together at work might spoil the time you get together outside of work. Do you know if you guys already have some common ground? Other than work of course.""
A: ""I have no idea, haha. That's what I'm hoping to find out at the party. From what I know, though, he is very open minded and very kind to the people around him.""
B: ""Well that's definitely a good start! Maybe talk about your pets to see if he is an animal lover?""
A: ""Ooh that's a great idea. Loving animals is a definite must for me.""
B: ""Since we'll be on the rooftop, you can always talk about the view too. ""
A: ""Haha true, that could be a good opener, maybe. How did you and your husband meet?""
B: ""Oh we're not married yet, but I think that moving in together recently is taking us one step closer to that milestone. We actually met on an online dating website. Being able to view his profile really sped up the ""getting to know you"" phase.""
A: ""So, turns out that the guy from work is allergic dogs, cats, and birds. Do you think it's still worth it to chase after him? ""
B: ""no way! you would never be able to live together ""
A: ""Yeah, good point. Maybe I should find someone else. Do you and your boyfriend keep any pets?""
B: ""yes we have 2 cats, they're like my children""
A: ""Ah, okay. So let me ask you--if your SO was allergic to your cats, and couldn't stand them, would you choose to break up with him?""
B: ""no i couldn't do that now, but if i'd have known before i started dating him i probably wouldn't have started to date him ""
A: ""Gotcha, that's understandable. What are your cats' names, by the way?""
B: ""they're called tom and jerry! like from the show""
A: ""Oh, those are excellent names! I wonder how Jerry feels knowing that they're named after a mouse!""
B: ""i think he would enjoy the irony if he knew!""
A: ""Haha, I bet! I wonder if cats can perceive these things. Or maybe identity is too complex--perhaps it's an exclusively human characteristic. ""
B: ""thats a very deep question. i'd argue it would be naive to think its just us that can percieve it""

A: ""Yeah, Saturday and Sunday! We can all go either days and maybe have a drink in our newly renovated shed afterwards and just chill.""
B: ""All of that sounds great to me. When did you finish up the shed?""
A: ""Last week, I just tried helping out my dad. He designed and mostly did the work. I have to take care of my kid so I didn't really have much time to help out. Do you think your husband can make it as well?""

B: ""The rainbow trough is, especially, good but can sometimes be a pain to find. I try to eat healthy because I want to start running soon. Have you run any marathons lately?""

B: ""I am sure. Running seems fun, but difficult when you are trying to train for longer distances. Is there any recommended training I should be doing to prepare myself.""
A: ""Just be realistic with yourself. You're not going to go from not running to running a 5 minute mile. Running a mile at first is a big accomplishment, even if it's 10 minutes or something. ""
B: ""I understand that completely. I love celebrating the small wins. I have been feeling stressed lately, so I figured running would be a good outlet. As a life coach, what advice do you give your clients when they are stressed.""
A: ""It's a great outlet for stress. Nothing makes me feel more calm and ready to take on a challenge than a workout. The best thing you can do is find a good outlet for stress and mix that in with your daily life. ""
B: ""That is some good advice. I do feel calm and more focused when I exercise. There are also the amazing health benefits too. Is it harder to run now, after beating cancer?  I am sure that takes a huge toll on the body.""

A: ""Its my BA but i think i will continue to get my Masters. Enough about me heh, hows your work outs going? The new machine good?""

A: ""I try to hit the gym when i can but ive been so busy. I usually at least try to get a run in every day though. Helps with the stress.""
B: ""Running can be great, at times I've been a runner. Used to be 3 miles, 3 x a week, goal was 10 miles a week. What's your distance like?""
A: ""I think the path i take is about 2.5miles. So i usually try to get in one round before or after school.""
B: ""That is a good amount, as it's enough to get your heart rate up to be sure. Many times, I have to be mindful of schedule and location, as it impacts how consistent I am. Bet you have favorite parts of the path. I love setting up goals to run past. ""
A: ""I do have some favorite trails but the path i take is around my apartment. Its close so i can get it done.""
B: ""Location, and being close, that's helps my exercise. Although many times, just keeping up with the kids will give you plenty of exercise!""

A: ""well 6 is better than zero.  Ive been missing my runs the past few days, been busy with school.""
B: ""School must be stressful since it's your final year. It's hard to stick to a good exercise routine when life is constantly getting in the way.""

A: ""Good afternoon. I hope you are well and healthy.""
B: ""I am. Just thinking about taking my bike out for a spin""
A: ""That sounds lovely. Are you an athlete?""
B: ""Not really. I do race my bike though.""
A: ""Wow. I wish my grandchildren were interested in something similar. But they like smartphones.""
B: ""That seems to be the thing now. So expensive too""
A: ""True. And I've come to know a great life does not come from expensive things.""
B: ""So tre. I just wish I didn't have to wait tables to get extra money.""
A: ""Its all tedious at first dear, but I know it will get better for you.""
B: ""I guess it just really want to be out on my red bike.""
A: ""Sounds like a true joy. I'm retired now, so you are inspiring me to try that.""
B: ""Awesome. Maybe we could go out riding together.""
A: ""I would love that. Life is too short to miss out on making new friends.""
B: ""I have to go, talk to you later.""
A: ""Are you part of a team that compete in bike races or do you compete individually?""
B: ""I compete individually I started doing it as a teenager. How many grandchildren do you have?""
A: ""I have four currently with another on the way. It is such a joy to be able to spend time with them. They are all so sweet.""
B: ""That's great to hear! By any chance, if one of them is interested in learning to ride bikes I would be happy to teach them.""
A: ""I have a grandson who is getting to the age where he is taking the training wheels off and I think he would love that. He's a wild one, so I bet he'd love to learn.""
B: ""Start them young! I can start teaching him as soon as he's out of training wheels. I hope I can meet your other grandchildren as well, you can bring them to the cafe I'm working at as a waiter. I would love to treat them to some hot choco.""
A: ""I will bring them by the next time they stay over at my house for the weekend. They love getting out and about and meeting new people.""
B: ""That's great!! Let me know the next time they are over. What did you do after retirement?""
A: ""For a while I just relaxed and got used to not working and spent a lot of time with family. I'm starting to think about new hobbies and getting into traveling now though. I just don't want to get bored.""
B: ""Yeah its the time to relax and unwind. You remember me of my grandad, I should visit him soon and show him my red bike. I have a competition next time, and I want to invite you.""
A: ""I would love to come! Just tell me when and where and I will be there!""
B: ""I am super excited! I'll invite my grandad too. Maybe you guys can get along. He's also retired.""
A: ""How many bike races have you won?""
B: ""Quite a few actually! It was my life as a kid, and now my career as an adult. Do you think you'd get one of your grandkids into it, as the training wheels are coming off?""
A: ""A lot of it, is listening to the kid, seeing where they are strong, and what they are interested in. I want to make sure my grand kids know how to use the breaks before I let them go on their own!  Love teaching confidence gradually to them. ""
B: ""That's great! How old is your bike riding grandkid?""
A: ""He's just started school and is getting down the alphabet and the like. Need to find something to focus all that energy on. Do you have a workout routine for biking, regularly?""
B: ""I do - a few miles every day in general, but when I'm training it's far more. I also do a lot of leg work. You may be interested in some biking holidays, actually, if you're looking for something like that.""
A: ""Ah, something that might get the kid interested perhaps. If it's something that makes you happy, sure feel free to share the biking holidays!""
B: ""My favourite 'track' (though not really a track exactly) is along the Venice Boardwalk. So much space, all that sea air!""
A: ""Sounds intriguing. Do you plan your vacations around nice places to bike? I bet Europe would have a few great treks. Riding a bike in my neighborhood, that's just fine too. Where was your last holiday?""
B: ""I do sometimes, but not always. Sometimes I like to have a chance to simply walk around. My last holiday was to Milan. The food is exquisite, as is the architecture. What about you?""
A: ""I tend to stay within my region generally, and many times the kids help figure out the destinations. Been thinking about the new season, there are some great forests to explore for hiking and biking. ""
B: ""Sometimes the best places are right on our doorstep - that sounds amazing. Got any favourites specifically?""
A: ""Do you bike to work at the cafe?""
B: ""Yes, most days I do.  If it's raining I don't because I need to not be sopping wet at work.  But otherwise that's my preferred way to commute.""
A: ""That's good. It's an environmentally friendly way to get to work! I'm glad you're reducing your carbon footprint.""
B: ""Yes, I definitely try to do that.  It can be a faster way to travel anyway.  Traffic around here can be pretty gnarly.""
A: ""Certainly. Sounds like you're pretty comfortable being on a bike, too, so that must be a plus.""
B: ""Yes, for sure.  Say, before you said that you were retired.  What did you used to do for a living?""
A: ""I was a petroleum engineer, ironically. I'd go out to oil fields and offshore rigs and help design the processes used for petroleum extraction.""
B: ""Oh wow, that's amazing.  Did you have a degree in petroleum engineering?  Or chemical engineering?""
A: ""I got a degree in chemical engineering. Many schools didn't offer degrees in petroleum engineering back in the day.""
B: ""Interesting.  I remember seeing a list of degrees and what their starting salaries were and chemical engineering was very high on the list.  I remember that because my uncle was a chemical engineer and he seemed to get paid pretty well.""
A: ""Yep, it's a very high-paying job. The oil & gas industry is pretty far away from God's work, but it is lucrative,""
B: ""That's what my uncle used to say, too!  They don't teach you to say that in school, do they?""

B: ""We got up a five a.m. and took a 3 mile jaunt all around our neighborhood. It was great exercise and a great way to start the day! How did your day start today?""
A: ""You're shaming us mortals with that routine!  I rolled out of bed, grabbed a cup of coffee, and watched the goats frolic while the sun came up.  Are you working today? ""

A: ""I haven't! I'm still obsessed with Call of Duty. Maybe that one could be my next video game. ""
B: ""It's a little bit like Skyrim if it were set in the actual Middle Ages and no magic.  Since you like Fallout, I think you will like it.  I wish I was better at COD, but I just die so fast!""
A: ""Haha that used to be me in COD, until I started playing daily and getting good. I'll give that game a try! Is gaming one of your favourite things to do?""
B: ""I don't always have time, but I do enjoy it when I can.  I guess I'm just so focused on my boyfriend.  Do you have a significant other and is it serious?""

B: ""There was a festival downtown a couple years ago.  He saw my car and asked me about it.  Then we spent the rest of the time together.  We really hit it off. How about your husband?""
A: ""How romantic!! That's a good first meeting story. My husband and I met at the dog park. Our golden labs used to play together and I always thought he was cute. He eventually asked me for my number and we hit it off!""

B: ""It's going pretty well. Kindergarteners can be exhausting sometimes, but it's an extremely rewarding job, and I feel very lucky to play an important role in these kids' formative years. You know, speaking of donuts, maybe I can bring some to class. I bet my kids will go crazy for them.""
A: ""I'm sure they would! You could tell them all about the dog park. Maybe it will help you decide on what kind of dog to get.""

A: ""Do your kids ever give you recommendations on the next video game you should play?""
B: ""Not really, and only because I haven't told them much about my video game habits. I'm afraid Call of Duty is a bit too violent for kids this age. Now, if I taught 5th grade, I'm sure I'd share, and I'm sure they'd give me some excellent suggestions.""

B: ""I liked kickball A LOT at your age. Wow, $25 a week!!!!!!!!! I only got $1/week at that age. Wow. What do you do with your allowance, generally! ""
A: ""Only a dollar? I could only buy one candy bar with that. My parents make me save $10 of it, and I buy snacks and drinks from the school vending machine with the rest.""
B: ""If you don't mind advice, I'd save more of it. Either long term for important things like college, or even for toys or video games or whatever -- soda and snacks are a waste.""
A: ""Is buying soda and snacks really a waste? I like them, though. Maybe I'll save money for when we go to Disney World this summer. I can't wait to meet Mickey and Minnie Mouse!""
B: ""Wow, Disney world! You'll have so much fun!""
A: ""I hope so! Have you ever been there?""

B: ""I visited a lot of civil war battlefields like manassas and gettysburg because my father was a big civil war buff. ""
A: ""That sounds fun. What did you like the best about 3rd grade?""
B: ""I liked reading more challenging books and making friendships with other kids. Do you have any friends in the 3rd grade?""
A: ""I have a lot of friends in my grade. Do you have a lot of friends being 20?""
B: ""I have about four or five close friends, but it's harder to make friends at this age, especially when you're not in school. I've been thinking about joining a kickball team to make more friends.""
A: ""Can you join a kickball team without being in school? I play kickball, but I play at school. Do you play basketball?""
B: ""There are kickball teams for grown-up, although we can't play as often because we have to schedule around people's jobs. I used to play basketball when I was younger, but not anymore. Are you good at basketball?""
A: ""I'm okay at basketball, but I am better at kickball. ""
B: ""I like kickball because there is not as much running as there is in basketball. I do not like to run.""
A: ""I like to run, but I'm not very good at running and dribbling the basketball. That's why I like kickball better.""
B: ""Are any of your kickball buddies going with you to disneyland this summer?""
A: ""Did you find a kickball team to join?""
B: ""Yes, our local park district offers one.  We start next week""
A: ""Do you know anyone who's going to be on the team?  Either way this should be a good way to make new friends.""
B: ""I know one other person, so that should be fun.  I can't wait to meet the other people that like the sports I like!  How's school going for you?""
A: ""I am doing alright in school but now I'm struggling in math.  We just got introduced to long division and I don't really understand it.""
B: ""Oh, long division is tough at first, but keep at it and you'll get it.  New things are hard to learn sometimes.  Is there a friend or someone that can help you ? ""
A: ""I tried to ask my parents but I didn't understand what they said to me and they started arguing with each other so I left.  Maybe I'll ask my friend Josh at school tomorrow.  He's pretty good at math.""
B: ""Oh wow.  That shouldn't have sparked an argument.  Sorry to hear that.  But yea, I'd say talk to Josh.  Maybe he can give you a different way of looking at it than your teacher explained and it will be easier for you to understand. Have you played kickball recently?""
A: ""We played it at recess today.  It was so fun.  I only got to kick once but I got a double so I was happy with that.  How many times a week is your team going to play?""
B: ""Just once a week for games, but I'm sure our team will get together for practices when we can.  Everyone works or goes to school so we have to work around those schedules.""
A: ""Yes, I can understand.  At school we have a hard time getting everyone organized to play at recess or lunch, and we all have the same schedule.  What position do you want to play in the field?  I like to play first base.""

So we can start by just doing some stationary moves with our upper-bodies, and then get more dynamic the more comfortable you feel.  And there are no wrong moves as far as I'm concerned.""
A: ""i'm very excited i like that there is no worng way to do it. how long have you been teaching?""
B: ""Well, I've never taught dance formally.  I've just taken classes.  But I do show other people some moves whenever they're interested.  Having a dance studio would be a dream of mine but that's a very long ways off.""
A: ""that would be amazing i hope one day you achieve your goal""
B: ""Thank you, that's very kind.  What was your dream when you were a little girl?""
A: ""i would love my own restaurant i am a big foodi""
B: ""That would be really cool, although restaurants are tough work.  What type of food do you think you'd serve?""
A: ""definetely mexican im really good at making it""

B: ""Wow! That is impressive. Swimming or running?""
A: ""Running. And I also do gymnastics it is my fave""
B: ""Nice. I prefer hiking and rock climbing myself. Living in co is great for those.""
A: ""Nice I love enjoy italian food and garlic bread""
B: ""Me too. I often go to company dinners at italian restaurants. What is your favorite dish?""
A: ""That is awesome. I love chicken alfredo""
B: ""Delicious choice. I love coming home from work to a nice plate of that.""
A: ""It is and I do enjoy it a lot.""
B: ""I work as a mechanical engineer so I do not know a lot about gymnastics.""

B: ""I'm sure. Have you ever been to colorado?""
A: ""No I've never been to colorado""
B: ""I live there, you'll have to come visit sometime. Great trails for running.""
A: ""I might be going to Colorado for a gymnastics tournament!""
B: ""I still am so impressed that you won a gold medal. We should get together soon and meet up at a great Italian restaurant. Would you like to do that?""
A: ""I'd love to!  That sounds wonderful!  Know of anywhere I can get some good garlic bread?  I think that's my favorite part of any Italian restaurant!""
B: ""Well when you get to Colorado we can meet. I just need to get a sate you will be here. Since yo may be coming to Colorado I can drive pretty much anywhere in the state to meet you consideing you will have travelled a ways to get to Colorado. I know of a bunch of great places that have delicious garlic bread. I live near Aspen. Do you know if you will be flying into Aspen or Denver?""
A: ""I was thinking Denver but I could probably fly into Aspen if it's easier.  I don't want you to have to drive too far!  Denver just seemed to have more flights and be a bigger airport but I think that they were the same price!  I'm not sure when it will be.  I'm hoping next month.  How's the weather in Colorado in May?""
B: ""Yeah Denver is HUGE! It is also very beautiful. The weather is really warm in May- not too hot- not too cold. We can also go hiking if you want- I rock climb in a place not too far from Denver. I may not be much of a gymnast but i can climb a rock like a pro. ""
A: ""I've gotten a bit out of shape since my Olympic days but I think I could still handle a good hike!  It would probably be good for me to get some high intensity exercise in!  I've been a bit lazy lately and after all that garlic bread and alfredo sauce I'm going to need to do something to burn off some calories!!  What's the highest mountain you've hiked?""
B: ""Oh- I thought you were coming to Colorado for a gymnastics tournament. Are you a participant of a coach now? When you were in the Olympics what was you strong point? I mean did you do floor routine- bars or horse. I think it is called horse-lol- but I know so little about gymnastics so I may be wrong. ""
A: ""Floor was always my strong event.  I loved to tumble!  I'm a coach now!  I just tell other people to do the hard work and I stand back and watch!  Which is how I've gotten a little out of shape!  People call the vault a variety of things - horse is one of them!  I've competed on beam and bars too but floor will always have my heart!""
B: ""Haha- yeah I guess with your love of Italian food you probably are better off coaching. And as far as you previous question about the highest mountain I have hikes- I really do not climb high mountains as I rock climb but I have hiked to the top of  Crestone Peak Mountain in Colorado. It took a lot out of me and like you, I am not in as good a shape as I used to be. ""
A: ""I bet the view was amazing though!  Do you ever get altitude sickness?  I always hear about that with people who climb up to high points in Colorado!""
B: ""The view was amazing! No I never get altitude sickness- knock on wood- I think because I took so freaking long getting to the top that my body acclimated to the higher altitude. So let me know when you will be coming so I can make plans on meeting up with you. I can hardly wait to see you!""
A: ""I booked my flight to Aspen for next month!""
B: ""That's fantastic! Is that for the tournament? How long will you be there?""
A: ""It is, I'm really looking forward to it! I booked the hotel for 5 nights.  Any sites you recommend I visit during the trip?""
B: ""If you like hiking there's lots of great places. I like Crater Lake Trail. It's also good for running. if you don't mind some hills""
A: ""Actually, I love running on hilly terrain! I'm a little worried about the altitude though since I'm quite in the same shape I used to be.  Is it really that much harder running in the mountains?""
B: ""That's a good question. I've always lived here so I guess I'm used to it but if you aren't used to it, it can be rough. Then again, you are in good condition so as long as you pace yourself you probably will be okay. ""
A: ""Yeah I probably will need to take it easy.  That'll be hard for me though because I know I'm going to be so amped up from the tournament that it'll be hard to contain that extra energy.""
B: ""if the weather's nice you can go boating on the lake. It's relaxing but it still uses energy for rowing. Too bad it's not ski weather, do you ski?""
A: ""I've never gone skiing before, but it sounds really exciting! Is there a place you recommend?""
B: ""Snowmass is one of the big ones but it gets crowded. I haven't been up there in a while. Maybe you can come back in the winter and we can explore together""
A: ""That might be a better idea.  I'll be busy with the tournament during the day, and I don't know when the slopes close in the evening.  I'll see how I like the area and I can let you know about a winter trip!""
B: ""that sounds good. If you have some time while you're here this time maybe we can meet for coffee (or an energy smoothie!)""
A: ""I was watching some skiing videos. It looks like so much fun!""
B: ""Yes, It's fantastic!  You'll really enjoy it once you have a chance to try it!""
A: ""I am very excited about my trip even more so now. With living in Colorado you must get to go all the time. What do prefer more skiing or rock climbing? ""
B: ""I like skiing more, but i usually find more time for rock climbing.  Have you ever done rock climbing?""
A: ""I have done indoor rock climbing but never the real thing. It scares me that i might not attach the equipment properly and fall. ""
B: ""When you come to Colorado, if you want to try it I can show you the ropes.  You are such a gifted athlete though you'll probably be great at it!  ""
A: ""Omg that would be fantastic. Thank you so much. This vacation just keeps on getting better. Have you been able to do any rock climbing yourself lately? ""
B: ""Yes, just last weekend!  I haven't been skiing for a couple of months though.  I'm anxious to get on the slopes again.""
A: ""Oh nice i bet you had a great time. Well maybe you can join me then if your free we can make a day of it some skiing and some rock climbing. ""
B: ""Sure! Of course, then you'll probably wind up winning a gold medal in the winter olympics too!""

B: ""I mostly rode around on my bike, the beach was very relaxing and breezy. I then took a bit time of later to eat some food at a local restaurant that sells good seafood.""
A: ""What did you get? ""
B: ""I got the shrimp plate, which is grilled shrimp coated in garlic. I also had it with some fried squid as well.""
A: ""Oh, I love squid. I like to get it breaded and fried. I also really like garlic shrimp. How was it? ""
B: ""It was really tasty and well worth the money. I normally don't get to eat seafood at my apartment, but I really enjoy the times I get to eat it at a restaurant.""
A: ""Yeah, I don't often eat seafood at home, but I love to get it when I'm out too. How has school been going for you? ""
B: ""Its been going well, I feel I have gotten accust to studying from home. My computer set up is well suited for online classes, and my internet connection isn't too bad either.""

B: ""I'm really glad to hear that. Being with nature is certainly a calming and refreshing experience.""

A: ""They'll only bite if the don't like you!  Haha, I'm kidding, but I can keep them in the backyard while we work if you don't want to interact with them.  Were you ever afraid of your black lab back when he was around?""
B: ""Not him specifically. Other dogs do scare me. You never know how they are being trained. Peoples beliefs can translate to how they groom their pets to be.""
A: ""Yeah, that's very true.  Some people don't treat their pets with any respect, so it's not surprising when they lash out.  I promise my dogs are well-trained, but I can still keep them away just in case.""
B: ""That sounds good. Thank you for understanding. What is it like to be a Pagen?""
A: ""It's very freeing, I like not being tied down by what others expect of me.  I'm still spiritual, but I don't feel obliged to act ritualistically.""
B: ""That makes a lot of sense. I feel the same about practicing the Left Hand Path. There is nothing more freeing than following your own path and not the ones others try to pave for you.""
A: ""So did you want to come over this weekend and I can show you around an engine? i've been reading more about the left hand path, it's really interesting!""
B: ""I would be happy to come over and learn more about how to fix cars. Its really interesting to hear more about it, I am jealous of those that can repair their own cars.""

B: ""That would be great. What year is your mustang, and when did you get it. Was it in working order when you first bought it or was it in need of a good repair job?""
A: ""I bought it last year with my Stimulus Money. Its a 1967 fastback. It wasn't running so I got it for real cheap! I plan on painting it fire engine red. ""
B: ""Red is a lovely color for a car. I wouldn't mind giving my Mazda a new paint job when I get the chance. Did you have another car before buying your mustang?""
A: ""I did, it was a 2000 Ford Mustang GT-8. Driving it was part of the reason why I wanted to get one of the older ones. I loved it! What color is your Mazda now? I have all the painting stuff, if you want we could paint it soon?""
B: ""My Mazda currently is a blueish grey, it came as it is when I bought it used. I don't think the previous owner painted it before, so I think it would be fine if I gave it a new paint job. Is it hard to paint a vehicle like mine?""
A: ""Not really. Its more time consuming and messy, but it can be kind of fun. What color would you want to paint it? Would you want it more metallic and shiny or just a single standard color?""
B: ""I think a metallic color would be cool for my Mazda, I was thinking something along the lines of an indigo color. Would you recommend a metallic or matte?""
A: ""I think indigo and a metallic shine/finish would look cool! Matte is always so boring to me. ""
B: ""Then a metallic indigo sounds good for my Mazda. I have also been considering installing a spoiler to my car, do you have experience doing that kind of installation?""
A: ""I just finished reading the sequel to the 'Left Hand Path', I think you would like it. Would you like to borrow it?""

A: ""I do my best, but I am not perfect. How directly do you follow it?""
B: ""For me, the left-hand path seeks a ""higher law"" based on knowledge and power. It is the way of self-empowerment and true freedom, in my opinon. What do you like about it?""
A: ""I enjoy the pursuit of knowledge. Truly knowing what I am following and trusting in that path. Are you learning any new languages at the moment?""
B: ""I am fluent in english, of course, and also spanish and french. I know you're not keen on learning new languages, but is there a reason for that?""
A: ""I feel self-conscience when I talk to a native speaker of that language. I do not want to feel like I am being judged. How do you become fluent and comfortable speaking another language?""
B: ""That's an understandable fear, but I can tell you from personal experience, when you travel, most people really appreciate that you even make the effort to say a few things in their native language. Practice is the key to becoming fluent.""
A: ""I think you're right. I think I need to plan a trip to a country in about six months, and then spend that time studying their language. Maybe if I immerse myself in it, I will not be so nervous.""
B: ""That's a terrific idea, and I think you'll have a lot of fun learning a new language. By the way, how are Dixon and Sirius doing?""

B: ""We went to this place called turning point near us, it was beautiful! Our hike for this weekend is planned for a place about an hour from us. Have you been on any hikes recently? ""
A: ""I was planning one for this weekend at a local state park.  It has some waterfalls that suppose to be amazing.  I am excited to go and spend some time on me.  A late birthday present for myself.""
B: ""That sounds so beautiful and relaxing. Yes you deserve it! How was your birthday, happy belated by the way!""
A: ""Thank you.  It was good.  I got to spend some time with family and a few friends that I have not seen in awhile.  We went to a great burger place.  It was awesome.  The hamburger had a fried egg on it.  Have you ever had one with egg?""
B: ""Oh wow that sounds unreal. No I haven't but now i'm gonna have to get one this weekend! I'm glad you had a good birthday though. ""
A: ""Yes, you should.  I was unsure at first but when I bit into it, it was really good.  What other plans do you have for this weekend?""
B: ""Yummy! We're planning on getting a nice bite to eat after our hike so I'm defiantly suggesting a place that has a burger like that! Other than that no other plans. How about yourself? ""
A: ""Just want to relax and enjoy the beauty of outdoors. We both sound like we have great weekends planned.  We should get together one weekend and do a hike.""
B: ""Absolutely, I would love that! Do you know if you are free for next weekend?""
A: ""My ex boyfriend tried to take my piranha while I went for a hike. The fish bit him.""
B: ""Oh my gosh, how did your ex boyfriend enter your place? Is he okay?""
A: ""He still had a key. I made him give it back!!! He was smart enough to wear gloves so he didn't get hurt. I'm just glad he didn't hurt the fish! I took the key back and am changing the locks. ""
B: ""I'm glad he didn't get hurt but that is so crazy! I'm glad you're changing the locks. Aside from that, how was your hike? Where'd you go hiking?""
A: ""I went in a park near me on Staten Island, High Rock Park. It has lots of trails and a nature preserve. Where are you going to hike this weekend?""
B: ""We're planning on going to a place about an hour away up north. It's about an hour drive from here but the trails there are incredible. How long were the trails? I'm looking at doing something that has some climbing nearby as well.""
A: ""Took my friend and me about 2 hours to hike this one but we were going slow at some points. It was a nice hike.""
B: ""That sounds great! Not too long at all. What was the view at high rock park like? Are there tables and observation areas where you can have a picnic? ""
A: ""Have you found a place to climb?""
B: ""We've actually had to cancel our trip because my boyfriend got really sick.  I'm so bummed about it.""
A: ""Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that. Have you rescheduled it for another time?""
B: ""Not yet.  I figure I'm going to spend the weekend nursing him back to health, and then we'll worry about hiking and climbing when he's better.  Are you actively looking for a new boyfriend right now?  Or are you staying single for a while?""
A: ""That's a good idea. I'm probably going to stay single for a while. I don't want to get into another relationship after having just gotten out of one.""
B: ""Yes, and it sounds like it ended badly.  Sometimes it's good to say independent for a while and figure out what you really want.  I had a really bad breakup before my current boyfriend and I spent some time finding myself and then my new boyfriend came along when I wasn't even looking.""
A: ""Haha, maybe that'll be my experience as well. I'm just going to stay out of it, and if someone comes along, great! If nobody comes along, then I don't mind being single for a little while longer either.""
B: ""That sounds like a good plan.  How long have you had a piranha, by the way?  That's a very unique pet!""
A: ""I've had it for about a year, which is also about as long as I've been single for. Guess I needed something to keep me company.""
B: ""You didn't want to get something more cuddly?!  I have a cat.  She causes me some trouble but she's also very warm at times.""
A: ""Cats are cuddly, but I'm afraid it'll scratch me to death. Piranhas are vicious, sure, but as long as I don't dip my hand into the water, it won't do anything to me. ""
B: ""Yes, that's true.  What do you feed it?""

B: ""Greetings, I like fish, not chips, what is your trabajo? Work""
A: ""I am a college student. Art major.""
B: ""I am unable to go out, too busy studying, lots on my plate, art? I like music""
A: ""Cool. Speaking of plates, I do love making paella""
B: ""Who is your favorite artist? Mine is wagner, do you speak espanol? Love paella!""
A: ""No spanish. Which is surprising for a descendant of christopher columbus!""
B: ""You love food! All I do is study, spanish now, french next, in between music""
A: ""I try to visit europe twice yearly. You should come with me then!""

B: ""Take medicine, sounds fun, let us go? You pay, okay?""
A: ""What type of music do you like listening to?""
B: ""I like Tool the band that is my favorite by far. I consider them to be a genre all on their own kind of hard to put them into a category. ""
A: ""Ah cool. Yeah it's always hard for me to classify the genre of artists. If it isn't clearly pop or rap I usually just call it ""alternative"" haha. So do you play any instruments?""
B: ""No sadly I don't play any, I had fiddled around playing an electric guitar for a few months but I never stayed interested enough in it to keep at it. How about you? Do you play any instruments?""
A: ""Ah, so do you mostly study music theory in school? Or do you sing? I don't play anything, I learned piano for a few years when I was a kid but was terrible at it haha""
B: ""I don't sing or play any music at all, just like you. You're related to Christopher Columbus? That's actually really cool how did you find that out? I've never had a genealogy report before.  ""
A: ""I found out from my parents, I never got a formal report but stories got carried down the generations. It'd be cool to do one of those though, see if there are any other mystery relatives I have""
B: ""Yeah, that's something you should get done. I want to get one done too, it could be very exciting finding out your ancestor was someone very famous who changed the world. It could turn out though to be pretty boring. That's probably what would happen for me, I'd be related to nobodies. You mentioned you liked making Paella what is that? ""
A: ""Haha well you never know! Paella is a spanish dish, mainly in Valencia. It has rice and usually seafood. I fell in love with it when I went to Spain and decided to learn how to make it. Do you cook much? ""
B: ""No I don't do much cooking, I am a TV dinner kind of guy. It's too easy for me to pop something in the oven and come back 40 minutes later and chow down so I don't do much cooking. Do you like cooking things other than paella?  ""
A: ""That makes sense, I'm definitely like that with some things where it's just easier to get it done with. I go through phases where I get obsessed with cooking certain things, so right now it's mainly paella, but recently I was trying out different pizza doughs""
B: ""I didn't even know there was different kind of pizza doughs, can you explain some of the different types? I am curious now. ""
A: ""Could you teach me some phrases in Spanish?""
B: ""Of course! Would you like to start with some basic phrases?""
A: ""I would love to know how to say some things related to food for the next time I visit Spain.""
B: ""That's a great idea! How about... ""Va a ser un refresco y dos tacos."" Can you guess what that means?""
A: ""Hmm, something like I would like a drink and two tacos? I'm really bad with language learning.""
B: ""That's right! You'll pick up the language in no time. When's your next holiday to Spain?""
A: ""Is it hard knowing/learning two languages like you are? I hope to visit again in the summer depending on airfare and family obligations.""
B: ""It can be hard, but if you practice a little every day, you'll soon start recognising words and phrases. It's all about becoming comfortable with the language. That sounds good - where in Spain do you want to visit next?""
A: ""We have family in Barcelona, it's crazy seeing my extended family.  I've always wanted to go to Seville or Madrid though!""
B: ""I bet! I visited Seville a couple of years ago - it's fantastic, and the food is so tasty there!""
A: ""That's good to hear, I guess that means I have to go now!""
B: ""Absolutely! There's lots to do there - some great architecture and lots to visit. And it'll be a great chance to practice your Spanish!""
A: ""I'm trying to decide between visiting Seville or Madrid when I go to Spain, and it's not easy!""
B: ""i have been to madrid and it is really cool but i think seville is more beautiful""
A: ""So which one would you actually recommend if I could only go to one?""
B: ""if i had to decide i'd pick seville its a better place to relax ""
A: ""That sounds fun.  I'll have other chances in the future to visit Madrid, too, so I think I'll go to Seville.  I'll have to see if my relatives from Barcelona want to meet me there.""
B: ""oh wow you have relatives in barcelona? i would reccomend visiting it is my favourite place in spain""
A: ""Yes, I visited them in their home before.  Barcelona is definitely an amazing city.  But I'd prefer to see something different, although I shouldn't visit Spain without seeing my relatives, too.  I assume you saw the Sagrada Familia?  What did you think of it?""
B: ""its an incredible building it will be amazing to see it when it is completed ""
A: ""Yes, I find it amazing that it's been in construction for over 100 years.  That sort of boggles my mind.""
B: ""its very close to completion now! it is mind boggling""

B: ""Her name was Zoey.  What makes you like cats so much?""
A: ""That's a lovely name! I like that they are independent, means i can spend all day at the construction yard if i have to. What did you do before retiring?""
B: ""I was a tailor.   I worked for a bridal shop altering dresses for weddings.  You should see some of the amazing dresses I've seen!  Now I just spend my days at the casino!  That's why I haven't gotten another dog!  My tailor job was so flexible I could work when I wanted to as long as I got the dresses done in time so I'd always be home to feed and let Zoey out!""
A: ""Oh yes that's right. I'd love to see some of the dresses i bet they were amazing! Have you considered getting a cat? You could still go to the casino and he/she would be fine on their own for a bit?""
B: ""I thought about it.  I've just never had a cat so I don't know much about taking care of them.  I've heard they scratch up furniture.  Is that true?""
A: ""Well yes i suppose they do but they can be taught not to as they get older, lots of people keep them outside in catteries, that could be an option. At least you could grill without worrying about a cat burglar nicking your sausages.""
B: ""That is true!  Although Zoey was so small she couldn't get up to the grill!  I'm partial to tiny dogs!  What is a cattery?""
A: ""Looks like I will have to work overtime next week. I need to find someone to come play with my cats in the middle of the day so they don't get too bored.""
B: ""Oh I can come over and play with them.""

A: ""Oh my goodness!! Is that your biggest win?""
B: ""Not quite, but it's definitely in the top 5.  I was thinking of taking some of it and donating it to the animal shelter.  What do you think?""
A: ""Awe I love the ASPCA. I got my last kitty from the local shelter. That's so nice of you.""
B: ""I was thinking that I could look at the animals when I go in.  I'm so lonely sometimes that I might be ready to get another pet.  I still can't decide if I want a cat or another little dog though.  After Zoey passed away, it was so difficult.""
A: ""A kitty might be fresh change after the loss of Zoey. I have found cats easier than dogs to care for. You should get another pet for companionship. Do you plan on going in soon t the shelter?""
B: ""Yes, I was thinking I would go tomorrow.  If I don't, there's too much of a chance I'll end up back at the casino.""
A: ""Well then get right into the shelter for a donation and hopefully an adoption lol. It could really lift your spirits. Any plans for dinner tonight?""
B: ""I was thinking lasagna.  Italian is always my favorite thing to cook.  What about you?""
A: ""I was actually going to try grilling and was going to ask for some tips. I am thinking grilled chicken should be easy, right?""
B: ""It's pretty easy.  Do you have a gas or charcoal grill?  I usually work with a gas grill.  Make sure to marinade the chicken for a while first, that way the flavor soaks in.  I also like to put the seasoning on right when the meat hits the grill.  It really builds up the flavor profile.""

B: ""I tip well to compensate him for the pain and suffering he endures from bringing me my unholy pineapple pizza, I do ride Charlie, sometimes. Other times, I just pet him, and we graze together. (On different things, of course.)""
A: ""I bet you could have a great social media following for Charlie, the pineapple eating pony. Have you thought about introducing him on any of those mediums?""
B: ""I haven't thought of that before. Maybe that's something I could consider. Maybe I can show off my pineapple pizza alongside it, too. I wonder if that'll boost its reputation, haha.""

B: ""Yes, and it also helps with depression I have found.""
A: ""Yes I wish I knew that before when I was a teenager""
B: ""Me too, it is good to know. Spread the word to others. Better than any medication.""
A: ""Yes it is I never thought about it but I just might thanks for the idea""
B: ""No problem. Always here to help a friend.""
A: ""So what else do you like to do on your spare time?""
B: ""Oh, I like to spend time with my cat, nelly.""
A: ""How is your cat doing?""
B: ""My cat loves cuddling and sleeping in my lap. She is so chill.""
A: ""Is she sleeping in your lap right now? What is her name?""
B: ""Yes, she is. Her name is Brandy. I named her after the Looking Glass song.""
A: ""Oh, I love that song! Have you gone for a run today?""
B: ""I ran this morning around the neighborhood. I like feeling the cold misty air on my sweaty face when I run.""
A: ""I know right!? I enjoy running early in the morning as well. How far do you usually run?""
B: ""I usually run until I can feel the sweat run down my back or I just miss my cat and wanna play with her again.""
A: ""Hm, for me that would not be very far, but I sweat a lot. How old is your cat?""
B: ""My cat is sweet 16. She is so pretty with her gray hairs.""
A: ""Wow! She has been around for a long time. Have you had her for her whole life?""
B: ""She has been around since I was young but not my whole life. But I have been around for her whole life though. I hope I can be a great parent for her.""
A: ""I would love to see a picture of your cat if you have one to hand?""
B: ""I don’t have one right now.  I lost my phone when I was shoe shopping last week.""
A: ""Oh no, do you think it was stolen?""
B: ""I think it fell out of my purse at some point.  I’m so mad, my running place list was on it too.  I’ll have to make a new playlist.  Do you have any song recommendations? What do you like to listen to when you run?""
A: ""I'm sorry to hear that! Oh yes, I have to listen to music when I'm running - it really gets me in the zone! I know I recommended my favourite song, Brandy by Looking Glass, to you in the past, but I love any uptempo rock songs when I'm running! What about you?""
B: ""I have a few other songs by looking glass that I like. I also like upbeat songs for running, but sometimes I really want to distract my mind and listen to audiobooks.""
A: ""Yeah, I know what you mean - I like listening to audiobooks too. I'm currently listening to a Terry Pratchett one - what about you?""
B: ""The last book I listened to was the Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy.""
A: ""That's a great one, I read that when I was younger - it's really funny! Did you enjoy it?""
B: ""Yes! But for my next book I think I’ll listen to something in the self help genre.  I was thinking something to help me cope with my depression.""
A: ""That's a really good idea - there's a lot of useful audiobooks available that I think would be really beneficial.""
B: ""I’ve been thinking about becoming a vegetarian to help my health and maybe improve my running.  Do you have any advice on getting started with a vegetarian diet?  ""
A: ""Did you get a new phone? Have you looked into vegetarianism more? How is your cat?""
B: ""Yeah I am picking up my new phone later today. Yeah I have I'm just not 100% sure if its for me so im just going to gradually stop eating certain things. My cat is not doing so well, I think she may pass soon. ""
A: ""Bless your cat, I appreciate you telling me. Also, I understand about gradually changing, and I think that worked for me too. ""
B: ""She has had a great life and will be extremely missed but i hate seeing her in pain. Yeah it really is a massive leap so I think I will make up a plan of what and when I will stop consuming certain things. ""
A: ""For me, it was a spiritual choice I think, to not eat animals. So, I started with beef, and kept chicken and fish for awhile. I like dairy though, and I need cheese sometimes. I appreciate the love you have with that pet. Sounds like they are loved. ""
B: ""See for me I hate the thought of animals being killed for me to eat and then the devil side of me is like but it tastes so good. So i am in an internal battle with myself. ""
A: ""Your feelings make sense. I struggle too. And after a few years, you get used to it. And then when you do eat it, your stomach is like what is this? grumble! I do feel healthier. That too. ""
B: ""Yeah a lot of people do say that they feel so much healthier and that is one of other reasons i want to do it. Especially now when then do so many non-meat items that are plant based. ""
A: ""I think it has to be realistic too. Otherwise I don't stick to the plan. I slip too sometimes. I hope your kitty is comfortable, I'll be thinking about them. ""
B: ""Yeah i will get there in the end. And thank you she is on pain killers but think she will go back to the vets in a few days. ""
A: ""One day at a time, with that kind of work. And grieving too. I need to take a break between pets. And my last pet had an expensive, protracted dying process, and I've taken a break since then. Looking forward to a pet again some day. ""
B: ""Yeah it really does take a toll. They are part of the family, it will be very strange without her around my i won't be getting another one for a long time. ""

B: ""Rebel! You must have a crazy high metabolism.""

B: ""Big is unhealthy. It is not fun.""
A: ""Aww. I am sure all will turn out well for you.""
B: ""Hopefully I will learn stuff in nursing school.""
A: ""Why do you want to become a nurse?""
B: ""I love helping people!  And my mom was a nurse and I was always so proud of her and saw how much the work meant to her!  What made you get into the music industry?""
A: ""Not surprisingly, because I love music. Got lucky that way. Are you you nursing school? I forget.""
B: ""Yes, I'm still in school.  I have one year left.  I can't wait til I'm done.  Working and going to school is so difficult!  I spend all night serving drinks to drunks at a bar and all day in the hospital doing clinicals and then I study until I go to the bar to work again!  It's exhausting!""
A: ""I'd imagine it would be! Kudos to you for balancing the two. I don't think I could do that. Any fun classes right now?""
B: ""I took all my classes the first couple years so now I'm basically just doing the work of a nurse for free in the hospitals!  A licensed nurse just follows me around and tells me what to do and supervises me so I get hands on experience.  It's better than being in a classroom but I can't wait until I can actually get paid to do it!""
A: ""I'd imagine. Honestly, that sounds a like exploitative. You should at least get minimum wage or something!""
B: ""Yeah but instead I have to pay tuition to do it!  It does seem exploitative, doesn't it?  How's your dog doing?""
A: ""She's doing really well! Actually had a client come by the studio yesterday who showed up with a steak from Ruth Chris as just gave it to her. Must be nice to be that rich.""
B: ""Wow!  If I could afford that good of a steak I would most certainly not be sharing it with a dog!!!  Hopefully once I get these student loans paid off someday I can eat like that!  What kind of dog do you have again?  I never remember""
A: ""A lab. She gobbled the thing down. And gave me a look like, ""How come you never feed me anything like that!"" I bet it'll be nice to have those loans paid off.""
B: ""For sure!  Should take a few years though from what I've calculated!  College isn't cheap!  I'm surprised she's even eating her dog food now and not holding out for steak again!  Ha!  I might do that if I realized there was something better out there!""
A: ""Have you encountered any interesting medical cases while doing your nursing work?  In other words, have any of the cases you have been part of been out of the ordinary?""
B: ""Most days in nursing are just routine but there are the occasional things that happen. It is amazing how much strength a small 90 year old woman has while they are confused and medicated. We have to be really careful as they can hurt us.""
A: ""Have you gone surfing again since your shark encounter? ""
B: ""I am not sure what you are referring too. I just work and eat all the time.""
A: ""I thought you were in school to become a nurse like your mother. Is your diet over, I had thought you were eating less?""
B: ""I finish school but I am working as a student now. I am still trying to diet but it is difficult. How are your dogs?""
A: ""My labrador Agatha is doing fantastic. One of my client brought her a new york strip steak last night. She loves to bark at the neighbor's dog. Do they have any therapy dogs at the hospital?""
B: ""Wow your clients really treat your dogs well. Hopefully they also bring you food. Yes there is an organization that will bring dogs to the hospital to sit with the clients. The dogs can't stay in the hospital but it is nice when they come visit.""
A: ""They bring me five guys. I love a cheeseburger almost as much as life itself! Some of my clients are really nice people, other's can be challenging to work with to say the least. Did you like working as a bar tender?""
B: ""Your dogs have more expensive taste than you they must be spoiled. Any job seems to have its challenges with clients. Nursing and bar tending seem like they would be so different but in reality they are both about making people feel comfortable. I made a lot of money as a bar tender and it can be fun sometimes its stressful it depends who the clients are. ""
A: ""Clients and customers can make or break a job. I never thought of the similarities between nursing and bartending in the terms you described. I mix cocktails for some of my clients in between recording sessions. It seems to loosen some of them up. Dirty martinis are my drink of choice. What's your favorite cocktail?""
B: ""I think it is really important to have soft skills no matter what job you are in. Sometimes people are difficult because nobody has taken the time to listen to them its amazing what engaging in friendly conversation with someone can do to a persons mood. Yes a good drink can also help sometimes I like to experiment with drinks I am still working on perfecting one I don't have a favorite but I like to keep trying new things.""
A: ""I'm about to have another cheeseburger.""
B: ""Ohhh, What kind of cheese burger? Like with bacon, or mushrooms and onion... Maybe some Avocado or jalapeno? ""
A: ""One with bacon and a fried egg. Its called the good morning burger. ""
B: ""Ohh that sounds amazing. My favorite one is one of my own creations. I can't have it now because of calorie count. But I put mushrooms, jalapenos, cream cheese, velveeta and rotel tomatoes into my hamburger meat. Then I make sure to use some good tempura batter as the binder and wrap the patty in bacon. ""
A: ""That sounds amazing. But can see why it wouldn't be a good option for you right now. Have you found any low calorie burger options?""
B: ""Well, I have been eating burgers made with lean turkey meat with avocado, lettuce, tomato and a mushroom bun. I also stopped eating fries. Which is depressing. Have you ever tried a mushroom bun?""
A: ""That sounds like you have good options. Even without the fries. I have never had a mushroom bun. I am not a big fan of mushrooms. ""
B: ""Ah well you'd have to be. I put a bit of olive oil and garlic powder on the large top mushrooms and bake them for like 10 mins. Then when they cool off, they work to hold the burger together. The turkey is good for you, but I don't like it. I always season it a lot.""
A: ""Well I am sure all the actions you are taking now will pay off soon for you. Have you been able to see any results yet?""
B: ""I started this journey when the scale said 350. I am only 30 lbs down so far and it has been almost 8 months. But I was not very in control the first 5 months or so and kept gaining it back the moment it was gone.""

A: ""Haha, I always tell everyone I am married to the money! Freedom and travel are my virtues""
B: ""I like money too. Money is the tool for the expression of freedom.""
A: ""I'm sure farming grants you the opportunity to make a lot of money""
B: ""The money I get from farming come from providing people with quality food products. It's a warm and wholesome type of currency.""
A: ""I have just booked my latest trip overseas to Spain, I can't wait to go.""
B: ""That is great what are you planning to do in Spain? Is it a vacation or are you going to look for a wife?""
A: ""It is just a vacation. I plan to do lots of sight seeing and eating. I love good food from small cafes. Do you cook a lot of what you grow on the farm?""
B: ""Almost everything I eat is from the crops I grow on my farm. My favorite thing to make is stew from my potatoe and onion crops. I add some beef to that and it is delicious.""
A: ""That sounds amazing. I travel often, but have never visited a farm before. I think it would be fun to visit your farm , play with your dog, and try your stew. Is it hard running a farm by yourself?""
B: ""It used to be hard but then I got into a routine for planting and tending my crops and now that I have a routine it can get a bit repetitive. I get so tired some days that I wish I could go on a vacation. You're lucky. You get to vacation in Spain. Did it take long to save up the money for that trip?""
A: ""It did take a while, but traveling is worth it. I get to see so many new things and take in so much culture. It can also be exhausting too though, with time changes and not understanding the languages. I think we are both lucky in our own way, doing things we enjoy. I can't have a pet because I travle so much. ""
B: ""I know! Having a dog is great. I love mine so much. But when you want to travel it can be a big hassle because you either have to find a neighbor to watch your dog, or you have to put the dog in a kennel, which can be a lot of money depending on how long you are gone. ""
A: ""I would feel bad leaving a pet with someone. I do enjoy the freedom to get and and leave whenever I feel the urge. I work remotely, so I can work from anywhere. It is so relaxing to take my laptop and work from the beach, or a hotel room. One of my favorite parts of traveling though is the food. Good local food. You must love being able to walk outside, pick fresh food and eat prepare it right away. It must taste so good!""
B: ""I do love doing everything local, and don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade my current life with one where I travel a lot. But every so often, when I talk to people who travel a lot, I get the travel bug. I wish I could go to Spain like you. I think it would be a lot of fun. Oh, I forgot to ask. Are you taking anyone with you to Spain or are you going alone?""
A: ""I am going alone this time. I sometimes travel with family or friends. I get a lot of frequent flyer miles and companion passes. I don't date much because I travel so often, but once and a while I trave with the person I am dating. I guess I find it hard to settle down with a person, not too many people can up and leave their jobs as often as I do. I am looking for someone who wants to live a nomadic lifestyle like I do.""
B: ""Oh, well then I hope you don't mind me asking, but since you have companion passes, do you think I could go along with you? Just as friends of course. We just have so much in common, and I'm at a good stopping point with my work at the farm, that I'd like to go on a vacation at this point. Don't worry, I understand if not. I just thought I'd throw that out there.""
A: ""I downloaded a dating app to find a partner. ""

A: ""Oh yes! I live in the desert so it's quite practical for me. I spend much of my time at home so I really appreciate it.""
B: ""I need to add more solar power to our home. Any ideas where I could start out small?""
A: ""What are some improvements you and your wife have planned for your house?""
B: ""We haven't really thought about home improvements for awhile. I suppose it is time to get a new roof. Do you have a solar roof? I am not sure if they have those here it rains a lot.""
A: ""We do have solar energy, but we also live in the desert. Lots of sun here, haha.""
B: ""Does your house stay warm at night? How do you get your organic food in the dessert?""
A: ""I guess the same way anyone else does...at the grocery store. The house stays warm enough at night. It can cool off quite a bit compared to day time temperatures. I really enjoy my home.""
B: ""Oh I meant does food grow in the dessert or is it all imported? Are you working on any interesting project in your home?""
A: ""Some times it grows in winter, but summer is hard on vegetables""
B: ""Do you grow anything at home?""
A: ""Just a few veggies so far. Zucchini, squash, and watermelon seem ok here. Carrots love the sandy soil.""
B: ""That's really interesting that all water filled vegetables seem to grow okay there. I would have never expected that. How is the water situation do you have to pay a lot of water in the house?""
A: ""Yes unfortunately water is very expensive here. Fortunately I live alone so it's not too bad. ""
B: ""Does the solar technology help with water?""
A: ""Have you given any more thought to those solar panels? I think it's a great idea even with the rain!""
B: ""Yes, I've checked into them a little bit. I just don't know how practical they will be with all the rain we get. ""
A: ""How much rain do you get really?""
B: ""Well, it depends on the year and the season, obviously, but it averages about 40 inches a year. How about the desert? When it rains is there a flash flood danger?""
A: ""okay but I still think those solar panel will save you a lot.  LOL it's pretty hot here you can't expect much from a dessert. it doesn't rain much so there isn't much of danger right now.""
B: ""Yeah, but it's not just when it rains. It's cloudy quite a bit, too. So on the days when it doesn't rain, sometimes there is a lot of cloud cover. I am thinking of moving to the desert, though. I think solar panels would really be of value there. ""
A: ""I understand. if you move to the dessert you will thank those solar panels everyday. Do you plan on moving ?""
B: ""We're thinking about it. I really like the diversity of the desert. I think I can work from pretty much anywhere. We're not tied down by our jobs. ""
A: ""I guess you will like it there. how's your job now? you were doing some data entry right?""
B: ""The job is the same. It's just data entry, so it's not rocket science or anything! Ha! I'm sure I can find work pretty much anywhere near a big city. How about you? How's work going for you?""

A: ""When is your next road trip?""
B: ""My next road trip is going to be to Florida, so i can visit my family. Do you travel often?""
A: ""That sounds like fun! Where in Florida do they live? I don't travel terribly often, only for an occasional vacation.""
B: ""They actually live in Orlando so im going to be doing the Theme parks which should be a ton of fun. I usually try to take at least two big road trips a year.""
A: ""Wow, that will be a blast! Have you been to the parks before?""
B: ""Yes i have, but it has been a few years. I am really looking forward to doing Universal studios.""

A: ""No not really but it was such a tragedy for the country I feel it is the patriotic thing to do. I read some books on it while working at the store and there are some things that really stick with you after you read some of the stories.  ""
B: ""That is for sure. I think all of us Americans have a connection in some regard. It really shattered us, collectively. Do you like modern art or more of the classics?""
A: ""Oh i stick with the modern stuff. I interpret things I see when I dance. I consider that my art form. ""

A: ""I do that in my spare time it is good excercise""
B: ""It is. I live french fries and burgers so I need to exercise!""
A: ""Lol well that is a good reason""
B: ""Yes, where do you live?""
A: ""I live in the sunny state of florida surrounded by my huge family""
B: ""That is so nice! I just bought a house in tennessee. Do you like florida?""
A: ""Yes I love it my children are always around and my grandchildren are always over visiting""
B: ""That is wonderful. I'm working on being healthier. No soda, just water!""
A: ""Water is all I drink because I had medical issues three years ago""
B: ""Well it is good for you. Do you have any pets?""

B: ""I have! I actually just took my dog on a walk this morning it was a beautiful day. What is your favorite thing to do with your black lab?""
A: ""My grandson has been coming over to teach him how to catch frisbees.  I really enjoy watching him catch them.  I also enjoy going on long walks with him, his name is Chocolate (in Spanish). What is your dog's name?""
B: ""That is so nice that you get to see your grandson more often! chocolate is a great name for a dog. My dogs name is tyson. How many grandchildren and children do you have? It must be nice to see your family expand so much. ""
A: ""Tyson's a nice name.  I have two children and four grandchildren.  It is such a blessing to have them nearby.. I have really enjoyed watching them grow!""
B: ""That is a big happy family! Also it is nice that you have your family living so close. How long have you lived in florida for?""
A: ""I have lived here for 30 years.  How about you? Do you have any children/grandchildren?""
B: ""I have two children ages 1 and 3. Two boys. I live in tennessee and my wife has to deal with a house full of boys haha. I am really enjoying my family at this age. ""
A: ""Oh wow! Yes, those are some pretty rambunctious ages.  I am sure you both have your hands full!  What do you do for a living?""
B: ""Yea we don't always get enough sleep between us but that's the way it goes I guess! I am a mailman and have been for about 3 years. I enjoy my job for the most part it pays the bills and allows my wife to stay home with the kids. How about you, what do you do for work?""
A: ""I am now retired but I used to be a teacher.  I taught mostly elementary school for 25 years. I really enjoyed teaching.  Do you have any hobbies?""
B: ""I really enjoy eating burgers and fries and watching sports when I can get some spare time. I don't mind putting on a few extra pounds for now! I have a lot of respect for teachers now that I am older with kids of my own. Teachers should be paid like doctors in my opinion. Where in florida do you like to walk on your spare time?""
A: ""We have plans for my family to have a beach day this weekend! It will be my dog's first time in the ocean.""
B: ""That sounds really nice. Will your grandson take the frisbee the beach? I wish we lived closer to the beach the closest one is a 4 hour drive away and that is too long for toddlers.""
A: ""My grandchildren aren't coming, unfortunately. It will just be me, my spouse, and my two children. Tennessee is quite far from the beaches in Florida.""
B: ""That's too bad your grandchildren are not going I am sure you will miss them. I am sure having a dog will be like watching a kid will the dog go swimming? Maybe when the kids are older we will go on a vacation to Florida for now we enjoy the parks here.""
A: ""I'm not quite sure if my black lab will go swimming. It would be neat to see him doing the doggy paddle, but yeah, I will have to watch him to make sure he's safe. What do you, your wife, and your kids like to do at the park?""
B: ""It will be fun to see how a dog acts at a beach. You know what is is like to have small kids they are always doing dangerous things so my wife and I have to watch them carefully. They really like to go on the slide right now though we just hope to tire them out enough so they sleep when we get home.""
A: ""I hope they sleep easily too, for your sake. You told me you and your wife haven't been sleeping the best.""
B: ""Yes it is still difficult managing routines my 1 year old only sleeps a few hours a night. It must be really nice to be a grandparent I can't wait until the kids are older.""
A: ""You will love it once you're retired and the kids are out of the house. Now that I'm retired, I'm taking it easy, just enjoying life with my spouse and Chocolate, the dog. How's the Post Office treating you these days?""
B: ""Florida is a good place for retirement. Post office is good I am used to the routine of the job its not to stressful. Its nice when all the dogs wait in the window to greet me but sometimes they can be a little wild. ""
A: ""Ha! That old cliche about the dog chasing or biting the mailman is true, I see! Have you been keeping up with sports in your nights after work?""
B: ""Fortunately I have never had a dog bite me but it is true some dogs really don't like mail. I don't know why you would think they would be excited about packages especially if they are dog treats. I have not been watching to much sports I try to give my wife a break by looking after the kids when I get home and then I am tired.""
A: ""You won't believe this but my dog actually started barking at the mailman after our last conversation! I think he was just excited to see a smiling face though.""
B: ""That’s amazing. I think that’s a really good sign. How did it turn out?""
A: ""We're working on socialization and boundaries, although I think progress is definitely happening. I've been looking forward to the summer, hanging out in a few local parks. Vacation plans in the mix? ""
B: ""Yeah it’s in the plans. I’ve been really busy with my sons right now. Neither are two but both are acting like they are going through their terrible twos.""
A: ""I love watching kids grow and change, sometimes they end up repeating things! I hear you there. Some days, just getting through the day is a big accomplishment!""
B: ""Watch anything interesting in spots lately?""
A: ""I am going to guess ""spots"" is ""sports"" I hope! We have a few seasons starting up, although the roster always seems to be changing. With summer, tennis will be active too. How's your dog doing? ""
B: ""Tyson is doing very well. He is really great with people. He’s a really good spot... sport I mean about going on walks. ""
A: ""Haha, I see what you did there. I'm glad to get exercise with mine, and is a big reason I decided to get a dog too. Mine's getting good at frisbee. ""
B: ""That’s great Tyson isn’t much of a “fetch” dog. You throw something and he looks at you like “you going to get that?”""
A: ""Well, maybe they compensate by being a good lap dog on the couch? Affection is a big reason to get one too. Pros and cons of keeping a pet guest!""
B: ""Yeah we get outside and exercise so I guess games isn’t the most important thing. ""

B: ""Haha yes! I saw it many years ago when it first came out and never finished it. It is super crazy and I can never get over how there is always something going on with that family.""
A: ""That Gallagher family sure is nuts! It's a pretty edgy show with a lot of bad language, sexual situations, and alcohol abuse. Are your kids old enough to watch it?""
B: ""Oh no, and even if they were I would not want them to. It made me even feel some type of way so I could only imagine their little minds trying to figure out what is going on. Do you have any plans this weekend? ""
A: ""How old are they? I bet they think it's super cool that their parent is a doctor! I'll be volunteering at the shelter all day Saturday, and I have a daytime wrestling match on Sunday.""
B: ""2, 10, & 13. They are a good age but still need to be protected from crazy shows like that haha That sounds like a pretty interesting weekend. Maybe we can stop by the shelter.""
A: ""I'd rather see you guys after work. I'd love to watch some Disney movies if you're up for that.""
B: ""I am, and I am sure the kids would love to see you again. Maybe next time we can stop by and help as well. I know the older ones are interested in volunteering. ""
A: ""Your 13 year old kid is old enough to volunteer. We'd love the extra help!""
B: ""I will let her know so she can get ready for that day. Maybe this summer when school is out. Then we can save and all go to Disneyland! ""
A: ""Our shelter just got new animals in. ""
B: ""Oh that is cool, sad, but cool. I wish all animals could have homes. But it is always fun to meet new ones I guess. Tell me about them.""
A: ""We got a tabby named Cabigail, and a litter of whippet puppies. Their eyes are just starting to open. I'm adopting one, his name is Marky Mark, I plan on putting him in races when he's grown. How is your medical practice doing?""
B: ""Same as always. Nobody delivering babies today. It is a nice reprieve. I need a vacation soon, I get tired of always having to catch babies after a few months.""
A: ""They sure do come out slippery! You almost need to put chalk on your hands to get a grip on a newborn. Are you going to take the family to disneyland again?""
B: ""I hope to sometime next year. Right now I am planning to get my surgery done next vacation, and once I am fully healed, I do plan to go back as often as possible. Do you think you will ever go? ""
A: ""Surgery!!!??? Are you ok? I wish I could go to disneyland but I'm not allowed with 300 feet of schools or parks.""
B: ""oh no, nothing serious. I am fine. Wait, what? Amusment parks count?""
A: ""That's the funny thing, I thought they didn't count, but you wouldn't believe the hassle I got when I went to 6 flags over Atlanta. Judge Melchenhough made it very clear that I can't be around any amusement parks or Chuck E Cheese restaurants. Some people just like to make things hard on the little guy..""
B: ""I guess rules are rules. I didn't realize you had such restrictions. Disney land is so fun. You are really missing out""
A: ""I'm used to all the rules now. Have you got your family more involved in volunteering?""
B: ""Not in the last couple of hours no lol. I do try to get them to join and do things, but not every minute. They do some already, but I want them to do more. I am thinking of making them adopt a highway and that would also help my business.""
A: ""I think I'm going to bring Marky Mark the puppy home this weekend!""
B: ""Thats awesome!  What breed is he?""
A: ""I think he is a mixed bred but it looks like a mix of German Shepard and Vizsla. ""
B: ""Sweet!  I wish we could have a puppy but with the children I am worried that it may be too much for them.  But I love dogs!""
A: ""You should go for it! Working at the animal shelter I know there are plenty of dogs that could use a good home. Just got to find the right bred that are good with children. Or are you worried that your kids won't take care of the dog? ""
B: ""im worried the kids wont take to the dog.  Maybe when they are older and are more responsible.""
A: ""That makes sense. It might be a good idea to wait. Feel free to bring your kids into the animal shelter to play with the dogs. You don't have to take one home but you can introduce the kids to the dogs. ""
B: ""THats a good idea, there is a shelter nearby that allows people to play with the dogs so they can get some socialization.""
A: ""Awesome! It'll be good for the kids and for the dogs. Be careful though once you get in there its hard to leave without a dog. What is your favorite bred? ""

A: ""Do you prefer working in construction? How do you feel about someday taking over the family business?""
B: ""I've honestly never done it. I suppose I'm trying to earn my father's love by taking it over.""
A: ""That's tough that your father hasn't been really affectionate towards you. Do you wish you had a more loving relationship with him?""
B: ""Of course. Growing up, he just gave me ""stuff"",""
A: ""Well I wish the best for you. Maybe working part-time doing construction for him would help strengthen your bond. The new job I got is actually doing manual labor working for my friend. It's very physically demanding but I have to pay my bills somehow. ""
B: ""Very true! And at least you know you like your boss!""
A: ""That is a plus, for sure. Friendship is different, though, in a business context. Sometimes it's hard to listen to him bossing me around.""
B: ""I can imagine. At least I'm used to my dad bossing me.""

B: ""Haha, thanks! Free is definitely my favorite ingredient for burgers.  The benefits aren't great, to be honest, but will hold me over until I start working with my dad.  I still have health insurance through my parents for now, so just saving up as much as I can.  Where are you working now?""
A: ""That's good that you still have health insurance from your parents. I'm in the same boat which has really helped me feel less anxious. I'm working for a friend, just doing manual labor. Started it recently but am not sure what I want to do for a career. If only wages were higher, then I could do something I really loved.""
B: ""If money were of absolutely no concern, what do you think you could see yourself being excited to do for work every day?  Maybe landscaping or gardening?  Might be hard to do that year round depending on the weather where you live though.""
A: ""I'd love to actually be a botanist. Studying plants and gardening would have been my passion but college was too much money. My parents didn't have enough money to send me to it. Maybe one day if school becomes free, I'll consider going. What's your dream job?""
B: ""That sounds like a pretty good plan and glad to hear you have something you are so passionate about.  My dream career would probably be working in Counseling so I could help people struggling with relationship problems like I did with my Dad growing up.  ""
A: ""That would be incredible. You should seriously look at pursuing a program on the side. I know that there are a few online schools that aren't too pricey for psychology. Would you want to be a therapist or a psychologist?""
B: ""Whichever one would allow me to buy more Whataburgers..just kidding lol. Probably a psychologist, but I would honestly have to look more into the differences as I haven't given it a whole lot of thought before you asked me.  Thanks for the encouragement!""
A: ""For sure!! seriously let me know if you need help with finding a program. While I am more into manual labor haha I do love challenging my mind!""
B: ""I definitely will do that.  Thanks again for the offer :).  Maybe you should be the Therapist, encouraging me to reach my dreams and all.  I hope you have a great night.  Enjoyed the chat!""
A: ""Have you looked into any psychology courses?""
B: ""Not yet.  Been too busy at the new job. Have you looked into any colleges for botany?""
A: ""I am planning on going to college to study botany , yes. Right now I do a lot of physical blue collar work for money when bills are tight. I have a new job oding manual labor for my friend so it is good that I am working for someone that I am close to and that respects me. ""
B: ""What type of manual labor are you doing?  It is always good to work for someone that respects you.  ""
A: ""I am doing a lot of gardening and planting around multiple local farms, it pays pretty decent actually. I never grew up rich or with old money, so these paychecks are definitely something new!""
B: ""That's awesome.  The gardening will give you a leg up with your botany.  Sort of on the job learning for your college classes when you go.  I always think the best way to learn something is by doing it.""
A: ""Speaking of that, maybe food service will help me get in touch with food too. I love burgers and never even worked a fast food job before. I have some time before the semester starts for college, maybe that will help.""
B: ""It will definitely help with people skills.  LOL.  You will come in contact with various personalities and learn how to deal with each one.  Hunger doesn't always bring out the best in people.  hahaha ""
A: ""Yeah I remember you mentioned you worked at whatsaburger and how you just got a new job, do you think I should apply for them too? Are they good service and establisment?""

B: ""Thank you and I think I will do that. Going to take me awhile to build up to a marathon though. Do you have any tips for me on running? Should I try a 5k first?""
A: ""Take your time. if your not use to running start out walking and each day try to increase your speed.   Stretching before and after is extremely important.  A 5k would be a good start if your use to running.  It will give you a sense of where your at with your abilty.""
B: ""Sounds like a plan. Hopefully when I'm ready to try biking, I can remember how. It's been years since I've been on a bike. Not a whole lot time to run and bike when I'm out sailing my yacht.

A: ""Occasionally, but I've never gone as far as France. Mostly I travel to good swimming or biking spots up and down the coast. Is the Texas gulf coast good for swimming?""
B: ""It's down to personal preference but I think it's a fine place to swim, It's not too harsh. have you ever thought about scuba swimming off a yacht? I'm around so im sure i could figure something out with you.""
A: ""That sounds amazing. Do you do it in the shallows or do you do deep-sea scuba diving? I love to swim so I'd be thrilled to try either.""
B: ""Haha I like to do it in the shallows, I'm far too scared to do deep sea stuff. how do you feel about the deep sea, regardless of wanting to swim there?""
A: ""I feel like it's beautiful and mysterious and thrilling, and yet also like it kind of wants to suck me in and drown me in a terrifying way. Still love the ocean though, you know?""
B: ""Haha good way to put it I suppose yeah. So anyway, is LA the only marathon that you travel for?""
A: ""It's the only one I regularly commit to every year. I do a few other marathons here and there, but the LA one is the only one I've repeated. Have you ever considered training for a marathon?""

A: ""Would you like to go shopping with me this weekend. I found an antique car shop. ""
B: ""I would be more than happy to!  Is there anything specific you are looking for car-wise?""
A: ""Yes, I am looking for old Porsche in the 1960's""
B: ""Oh I love how Porsches look!  I don't know too much about what would make it a good buy or not, but I'd love to look.  How much are you looking to spend?""
A: ""I don't have a lot of money, hopefully around $20,000""
B: ""Well hopefully we will have some good luck!  Say, have you thought about getting a dog?  I know how much you like them.""
A: ""I love dogs. Do you have a dog, if yes, how many""
B: ""Yes, I have a golden retriever named Sally.  She's a total sweetheart.  Would you ever consider getting a dog/""
A: ""Yes, I would like a dog, but I am having a hard time deciding what type of dog to get, can you give me a suggestion""
B: ""Absolutely! Since you enjoy the outdoors, I think you would do best with a more medium or large-sized dog.  Maybe a retriever or a collie.  Boxers are also a lot of fun!""
A: ""Yes, I was thinking about a Boxer, but I don't know much about a Boxer""
B: ""They are amazing dogs!  They are so sweet and cuddly, but they do love getting out and burning off some energy.  When they get excited, they run in circles and chase their tails...it's so cute!""
A: ""I think I found a Porsche I want to buy.""
B: ""That's great! I know you've been wanting one. What year is it?""
A: ""It is a 1965. It is a great blue color. What do you drive?""
B: ""I don't drive anything too fancy, just an old Honda Civic. It hauls around the dog which is all I need. ""
A: ""I respect that. Saving on a car payment is always good. I just love old cars so much. ""
B: ""Besides the Porsche do you have any other favorite old cars? ""
A: ""I love Jaguars and old Italian cars. What is your dream car?""
B: ""I have always dreamed of a Rolls Royce. I've seen them in movies and they just look so comfortable to ride in. ""
A: ""They are dreamy for sure. I can't wait to take it for a nice drive.""
B: ""I love getting outside. Is there a favorite spot you love to drive to? ""
A: ""I live driving to the mountains even though it still scares me a little bit.""
B: ""The mountains are beautiful. Is the road a bit bumpy up there? I imagine that wouldn't be good for a Porsche. ""
A: ""Have you taken your dog out on any scenic drives lately?""
B: ""Yes always, I take sally out on walks every day. I drive her in my old Honda Civic hen I am going somewhere but I really want her to see how a Rolls Royce car feels.""
A: ""Oh I would love to drive a Rolls one day but they are quite expensive. Even the older ones are. I wouldnt mind finding a classic and fixing it up. I wonder how it would do in the mountains. They tend to be large cars and some of those mountain roads are narrow!""
B: ""haha funny you mention that, I find mountains to be beautiful. I know Is aid that last time we talked but I have to put emphasis! Rolls are great but what about that old italian car you were thinking about getting? The retro style is sick man!""
A: ""I found an old Porsche but havent decided if I am going to go that route or keep looking for something more Italian. What do you like more?""
B: ""I definitely like the italian cars better, they give a more mysterious and cynical look to them. Reminds me of the old gangster movies , probably why I think hey look so cool. However, I dont know much about valuing old cars.. so dont ask me lol/""
A: ""I have a good down payment but it is hard to find those old italians around here. Once you find something shipping it can be a nightmare too!""
B: ""You do have around $20,000 to spend on a car haha. Which is massive , especially since I am a teacher you know pay isnt that great haha. Whatever you get make sure to drive it down the mountain! ha""
A: ""Half the fun is just shopping for the perfect car. You can be amazed at some of those old bar finds. You really never know what you are going to come across. I can say though, you teachers are so underpaid! You are helping shape the future of this country and planet by molding the minds of our children. I applaud what you do!""
B: ""I appreciate that, I enjoy being with the kids and being active a lot so it makes up for it . I like walking outdoors with them and the recesses is always really great for teachers aswell. It is always a fun environment !""
A: ""I imagine so. Do you ever get to take Sally with you? I bet the kids would love playing with her!""
B: ""I take sally with me everywhere! We go shopping together too. My kids really love her, you should get that boxer breed you always wanted. I still remember you talking about it from last week!""

B: ""Oh yes! Believe me, i would know nothing about the internet if it were not for my grandson! I usually sit down with a cup of tea and relax next to the grandkids, while they either play on their tablet or teach me how to use it. I definitely did not have anything like it while i was growing up. ""
A: ""I agree. I was lucky if it was my turn in school to even use the computer that day. And living on a farm also limits the amount of internet time I get. The other day we had a storm and I had no internet for weeks. ""
B: ""Wow! That must have been so difficult to handle. I am used to no internet, however, i think my kids and especially my grandkids would go crazy if they didnt have it for even a couple hours.""
A: ""haha I know! Some of us have been so dependent on internet that once everything is gone we do not know what to do with ourselves. Or at times I have heard of people taking it away as a form of punishment. ""
B: ""Yes! That is defintely what my daughter does to my grandkids! They really listen then!""
A: ""So have you read anything interesting lately that you would recommend?""
B: ""I actually just finished reading a book called Killing Caleb it had so many twist and turns in it, was a incredible story to read.""

B: ""A man gets sent to a mental ward and has to prove he isnt crazy.   ""
A: ""That does sound enticing! I haven't read much in the way of literature. How would you suggest I get started?""
B: ""It has a very good story line, i would defiantly recommend it. Honestly i would just start of with a smaller book of the genre you like to read and go from there.""
A: ""What's your absolute favorite genre to read? I feel like you've read just about everything, being a librarian haha!""
B: ""Honestly anything genre as long as it contains some drama, nothing beats a good drama story.""
A: ""I'm guessing you've pushed pretty hard for your grandkids to get into reading?""
B: ""Yes i started reading to them very young, a few of them love to read now so i will take that as a win. ""
A: ""That's wonderful to hear! You must be so proud of them!""
B: ""Yes very proud they are a bunch of great kids. How is living on your farm going?""
A: ""I've been looking for books that take place on a farm, might as well start reading about something I know!""
B: ""Great idea! I love steering people toward books they will enjoy! Have you read any james herriot? He was a vet surgeon and has some very interesting stuff ""
A: ""I don't think I have. But that sounds really interesting. Does he right fiction or non-fiction? What are his books about? ""
B: ""He writes non-fiction. One is ""All Creatures Great and Small"". They are about his life as a veterinary surgeon with all kinds of animals. What do you like most about living on a farm?""
A: ""I'll put that on my books to read. That will be right in my wheel-house. I really enjoy being able to go out a accomplish something everyday and actually see what I have accomplished. I get to work hard and when the job is done relax and enjoy the beautiful country I live in. ""
B: ""That sounds wonderful! I am looking forward to retiring in a few years and enjoying the scenery everywhere I go. It makes me reflect on life and serving the community. You must put a lot of effort into your work.""
A: ""It is tough work but it is rewarding. If you retire in Spain do you think you will live in the country or live somewhere in the city? ""
B: ""I will keep my farmhouse and live there primarily. I would also like a vacation home but don't want to be too far from my grandchildren, so I haven't decided exactly where that will be yet. ""
A: ""Sounds like an ideal retirement! Family is important If I had grandchild I don't think I would want to move away from them either. How far do they live away from you now? ""
B: ""They only live 30 minutes away right now so I get to see them often. I travel to visit them as often as I can. They are the light of my life!""
A: ""I hear being a grandparent takes the best parts of being a parent without the downside is that true? 30 mins isn't too bad at all. ""
B: ""Yes it absolutely does. I was a stressed out mother, but I am a very calm and caring grandmother. I feel like I can correct all my mistakes now!""

A: ""When I'm old enough to shop for myself, I'll.""
B: ""Good. Only buy organic, because its good for you.""
A: ""I will remember that. I should get back to the playground now.""
B: ""Have fun! And stay safe out there.""
A: ""I will. You can come if you want to. I have lots of friends.""
B: ""I will think about it. But I have a feminist march to attend later.""
A: ""Sorry I didn't make it to the playground. How are you friends. I hope you had fun without me.""
B: ""It's okay, I didn't want to go anyways but my other friends forced me. They're doing good, but I wish they understood that I'd rather spend time online than go to the playground.""
A: ""I wish I could spend more time online! I want to go on Twitter but my parents won't let me. You're lucky that you're allowed!""
B: ""I think it's because my mom wants me to learn about a lot of other people and how the world works. It's on Twitter that we found out about the feminist march happening later. You should ask your parents if you can join!""
A: ""Oh that sounds interesting, but I don't think they will let me go. They won't even let me go shopping by myself. ""
B: ""That stinks! I'll have to tell you about it in class on Monday then! Speaking of class, did you finish the homework assignment yet? I really wish we didn't have to write about Disney and Mickey Mouse!""
A: ""I can't wait to hear about it! Yeah I've done the assignment! I love Mickey Mouse so much and I really want to go to Disney World! This assignment has made me want to go even more! Don't you like Disney?""
B: ""No way, Mickey Mouse is boy! Besides, women rule the world, so why waste time writing about some old guy?""
A: ""But Micky Mouse is so cool! I still like him even though I'm a girl. Okay women rule the world but Mickey can join in too! I want to go surfing with him!""
B: ""Well you can go surf with Micky Mouse, and I'll stay on the beach surfing the web. Or maybe I'll go fishing so we can have fresh fish for dinner! Isn't organic food always the yummiest?""
A: ""Alright that's a plan. Eugh, I hate fish and I can't tell whether a food is organic or not. I just want to play with my friends.""
B: ""You can tell food is organic because it tastes fresh and crisp! But if you're not used to it, it can be hard to tell. Maybe at school we can play farmers and grow our own organic food!""
A: ""How was going to the feminist march?""
B: ""It was incredible!!! Such an empowering movement. I'm looking at writing about it for one of feminism in politics classes at school! ""
A: ""Oh, that sounds really interesting.  What did y'all actually do at the march?  I have never really gotten to attend any political rallies or marches.""
B: ""We all brought posters addressing issues with women rights and connected with each other on Twitter! It was great to see and the network is so strong""
A: ""Oh man, that sounds really cool. I love making art and posters.  Walt Disney was my favorite animator of all time and really inspires me with his creativity to bring so many characters to life.  What is Twitter like?  My parents are still being bossy and not letting me join""
B: ""ugh that sucks!! I hope you can join when you turn 18. It's let me learn about so many problematic issues. I'm so thankful I'm on it otherwise I would still be eating fast food all the time!!!""
A: ""Uh oh!  I don't know if I am looking forward to joining as much as I thought I was if it means I have to give up fast food..lol.  What did you see on there that made you give up fast food?""
B: ""SOOO many disgusting things about meat quality haha. I promise it's worth it though! I've felt so much healthier since I stopped eating fast food. Organic food needs to be the default though... I hate how easy it is for large companies to decide everything we do""
A: ""Hmm, interesting!  I still can't really decide what to buy or anything, but my parents never buy organic food and I seem to be doing fine.  I guess you don't really know what you're missing if you've never tried it though.""
B: ""Dang, your parents seem quite controlling haha. What else do they decide for you? Agency is so important.""
A: ""Haha, I know but they do love me and care about me.  Well, like for example, I still have a bedtime, can only have 1 hour of screentime a day, and have to ask permission to sleep over at my friends house.  What does agency mean?""
B: ""Agency is when you're able to make your own decisions or when you can learn how to make your own decisions. That's fairly standard. The 1 hour of screentime a day must be hard. How do you use it?""
A: ""I started a conversation today with my parents about Twitter.  I told them that I understand their concerns but that I want to use Twitter to connect with others and learn.  They said I should be more specific about what issues I want to learn about and what kinds of groups I want to connect with on Twitter and then we can discuss it more.""
B: ""I can see their point, but it wouldn't be difficult for you to come up with something. Lots of cultural groups have Twitter accounts you could follow.""
A: ""Yeah that is true, maybe next time I will write down different types of groups I would like to join and if they see it on paper maybe they will feel different. ""
B: ""You probably like reading or music or something. You could find a literature group or an author that tweets.""
A: ""Yeah that too. I will ask my friends what there parents allow so I myself can get a better idea. Thanks for the insight. ""
B: ""I don't know if you're interested, but there were lots of younger women and girls on the march yesterday. It was great!""
A: ""Maybe I can ask my mom if I can join you at the end of the month for the feminist walk. I think my mom would enjoy doing that too, if that is ok if we tag along. ""
B: ""Yes, that would be great. Do you think she would mind that we met online?""
A: ""I never actually thought about that. Maybe I will leave that part out. She will be with me anyway so shouldn’t be too much of a problem.""
B: ""I would love to meet your mother. I'm sure she's a really great person.""
A: ""Other than her style of parenting she is super kind and very goofy. I’m sure you both will get on great. ""

A: ""Have you tried any new ways to eat fries? My might want to try chili cheese fries.""

A: ""No, I have not done much dancing recently. What is your favorite style of dance?""
B: ""My favorite style of dance is samba. What about you?""
A: ""I think my favorite style is probably the waltz. It's so very fun to watch. Have you ever taken dance classes?""
B: ""Yes, I have because I am not good on dancing. What about you?""
A: ""You dance five days a week and have taken lessons but are not good at dancing?""

B: ""How awesome!! It must of have been so much fun,how long did you have to wait in line for those tickets?""

A: ""Oh ya!  That was her first hit.  She had that video where she looked like a cheerleader.  I haven't heard the new Rascal Flats song.""
B: ""O too bad. I do like it though. All of her songs are my favorite, what's yours?""
A: ""I can't just pick one song, but I do really like her early stuff.  It reminds me of being a teen. ""

A: ""What do you miss most about those good ol' teenage years?""
B: ""I guess mainly just how dumb and naive one can be and doing or saying anything without worrying about the consequences of our actions. ""

B: ""I'm happy to hear I'm not the only one!!! Britney is the bomb, right? Funny that you mention it, next week I'm going with a couple of friends to Yellowstone, have you ever been there?""
A: ""Darn right, she is! That sounds fantastic! I've never been there. Do you usually go with friends, or do you do solo trips, too? If I go, I can't decide if I'd rather be alone or not.""
B: ""I like going with at least someone else, it can go from fun to not-so-fun very quickly if you happen to get stranded or lost or without reception. It happened to me once when visiting the Grand Canyon. I truly felt that was the end""
A: ""Oh, God, that sounds terrible. I think that place is too big for me, anyway. I'd always feel like I'm either about to trip off of a cliff, or be turned around and get lost. Did you have a guide on your first time? I think that might make me feel safer.""
B: ""I had the same feeling but didn't trust my instincts. I went there thinking it would be pretty easy to not gets lost, and 36 hours after I was suffering the consequences. If I'm talking to you today is because the hostel I was staying reported me as a missing person. A guide or just a going with a group in your first treks is the best choice, trust me.""
A: ""Oh, Jesus. That's like something from a movie. I'm glad you're still okay and with us. Taking that into account, and how sluggish my new diet-change is going, I think it may be a while before I feel up to that, haha. You know, an upcoming trip that I'd like to make is to a concert. Its been forever since I've been. We should go see Rascal Flats sometime--get you to brush up on them.""
B: ""If you have watched the movie 127 hours, that's how I felt even if I was really not trapped. Concerts are amazing, as a music enthusiast myself, I aim to attend one or two per year, so sign me up to go and see the Rascal Flats. That sounds like an amazing idea""
A: ""Yeah, that's what I was thinking of! But I didn't even want to mention it, since it's so grizzly. And a true story. Heck yeah, that sounds great! You know my favorite, so I'd love to be formally introduced to your favorite at a concert!""
B: ""Of course! We can do a double date and enjoy some relax time together and share with you guys in more detail my other crazy stories when going on treks!""
A: ""I've just booked concert tickets to see guess who?  Yep Rascal.  Are you booked yet?""
B: ""Yes you know it! I had an alert on my phone for when they were released. Do you have any plans for the weekend? Any national park trips planned?""
A: ""I do. I'm stopping by Britney Spears' house and then heading to a hike in Yellowstone. Do you think she'll come with us if you sing a song to her?""
B: ""Me and Britney are good friends, she recognises me now after meeting her at so many concerts so I'll see if she wants to come to Yellowstone. Are you going to go fishing while you're there?""
A: ""Of course I am. Fish is great for my keto diet. I'm trying to stock my freezer at home. I want to be friends with Britney so we can store any extra fish at her house. I plan to catch a lot!""
B: ""Brit's favourite food is fish too so she will love that. I'm scared of running into a grizzly bear in Yellowstone. What's your biggest fear?""
A: ""I'm afraid of showing up to trivia night where all of the questions about country music. I'd be a horrible team mate. I know so much more about fish!""
B: ""I'm so nostalgic about music from my youth, any quiz questions about 90s pop and I'd be great. What would be your best quiz category?""
A: ""I'd be great with questions about Rascal Flatts. I just booked tickets to see them it would seem!""

B: ""Yes exactly! Basically I don't verbally speak but I use my phone to communicate with friends and family. It was difficult at first but I'm used to it now and have really enjoyed my non-verbal journey! Would you ever go non-verbal?""
A: ""I could give it a try, but I love talking so much. Does that affect your work or school?""
B: ""I work as a pilot but am currently on sabbatical so I haven't flown since I've been non-verbal. We will see if I'll continue when I go back to work. And yeah it sounds like it would be hard for you then lol""
A: ""My dance teacher believes I can be a professional dance instructor before too long!""
B: ""That's great to hear! I know you can. And I'd love it if you can teach me, sometime! I think having a teacher that I know would make me feel more comfortable learning.""
A: ""I would love that, maybe you could start flying again since I don't live nearby""
B: ""Well, I'm still non-verbal. It's important to me to be strict in my convictions. So, as long as you're okay with that. And sure, I can fly--just not as the pilot. Do you think salsa-dancing is a spiritual dance?""
A: ""I think any dance is spiritual. It lets you release all your energy. Do you have a song you would like to learn a routine to?""
B: ""Oh, I always get into the music that you play when we line-dance! And that's usually just stuff from your childhood. So, I'd love to have you teach me something from the 80s! Maybe I can be a practice-student for you, so that you can have an easier time teaching many students.""
A: ""That sounds like a plan. We will have to get something on the books. ""
B: ""For sure! And when I'm flying again, I'd love to be your pilot on a trip to Alaska. You've got to see the Northern Lights! It's the most spiritual scene in the world. What do you say?""
A: ""I have always wanted to go and see them. I appreciate the offer greatly. Is there a lot of wildlife around your home?""
B: ""That'd be great! And oh, yes. But they keep to themselves. You'll see foxes and such around the home. Moose a bit further past the trees. And truly out there, is where you'll find the more unique creatures: caribou, wolves, beavers, and such. Are there any particular ones you'd like to see?""
A: ""I would love them all ""
B: ""Oh, yes! They're all a marvel. Of course, wolves and bears would be terrifying to stumble upon. But I love to spot foxes in the wild. They're sneaky little creatures, but they always have heart. I feel they're very spiritual.""
A: ""I hope i get to see those spot foxes soon.""
B: ""I live in a cabin with so much wildlife around, do you want to stay over?""
A: ""I'd love to as long as I can bring my lite brite with me. It's my favorite toy. Does your cabin get cold at night?""

A: ""Haha ah yes of course, I should have realised that's what you meant. That's so exciting that the baby is due so soon. I'm not sure if I could deal with the anticipation of not knowing whether it was a boy or a girl! I'm not sure what it might be; does she have any other children?""
B: ""It is her first. Kinda weird though, them both being pregnant at the same time. Hope it's not by the same guy! lol. Now that would be a good book to read!""
A: ""Wow yes that would be an interesting read! If it's her first, something tells me it will be a boy. Also since it's her first she might end up being overdue! I've never had children myself, though I am a godparent to my best friend's kids. Are you a godparent to anyone?""

A: ""Just follow one gymnast or one team. Then it's easier. ""
B: ""Yeah, but they are so many events, like when they spin around bars, then they jump on a mat, then they jump on a beam and then they jump over some sort of stool. All those events happen at the same time. It does not make any sense to me.  ""
A: ""The vault, is the stool they jump over. Just try that watching that. Basically, the more tricky the more points you get. But they take points away if you don't land gracefully. ""
B: ""Yeah, but on the TV, they show 3 contestants for one event then they switch to another event. It is very difficult to follow. I guess it is easier to follow when your are on the floor.  ""
A: ""I get what you mean. Would you like to come to competition with me? Then you could just follow one event. ""
B: ""I would be great, where do I to buy a ticket  ?""
A: ""You get them online from  gymnastics USA. Or If I'm going too, I can get you an extra ticket. ""
B: ""That would be great, I will invite you to a football game next time. When do you have a free weekend ? ""

B: ""Wow way to go! Were there a lot of spectators there? I'd love to go to the next one.""
A: ""Thanks! You should try exercising  maybe you can become a gymnast one day.""
B: ""I exercise a ton actually. Working out is one of my favorite things to do. And I'm in the Army so I'm definitely in shape. I may try gymnastics sometime.""

B: ""We have a black Labrador. Do you know what they look like?""
A: ""Hmm, not really sure besides being black. What do they look like then?""
B: ""They're medium-sized and have long black hair that sheds everywhere! Their paws are webbed so they are very good swimmers.""
A: ""Are they they kind of dogs that like to play? ""
B: ""Yes! They are retrievers. They love when you throw a ball into the water. They swim out and bring it back. Do you like to play with dogs?""
A: ""I've never had one so I don't really know. When I watch YouTube videos of people with dogs it looks like fun.""
B: ""Why don't you ask your parents if you can come to the lake with me and the kids and Bear (the dog). They could come too.""
A: ""They might freak out if they find out the dog's name is Bear.""
B: ""He's very sweet! I can talk to them about the dog if they want.""

B: ""That's what parents do. I remember it can be annoying sometimes, but they just love you more than you can imagine.""
A: ""I talked to my parents, they are willing for me to meet your dog.""
B: ""That's great. Bear is very friendly so they will love meeting a new friend! I'll bring one of the many tennis balls that they've claimed as their own! Would your parents be happy for us to meet at the park?""
A: ""I will ask them and let you know! How old is bear?""
B: ""He's 4 now, though still acts like a puppy even though he's adult sized. Are you ok with bigger dogs? Some people can find them a bit daunting.""
A: ""I will get use to him, one of my best friends has a big dog and we get along really well. He drools a lot though!""

B: ""I haven't been training as much as usual as I've been doing quite a bit of work on the house. But in a couple of weeks I'm starting more intense training again. Do you get to play tennis at school?""
A: ""No, once I move to the high school I will be able to join the team though. you may have to give me some tips!""
B: ""I first got introduced to tennis at high school too. I think the first tip I would give is to keep your wrist straight when you hit the ball. If you bend your wrist you can get injured quite easily. Have you ever had a sporting injury?""
A: ""What work have you been doing on the house?""
B: ""Mainly cleaning, and some light renovations, I replaced an old sink.  And you what did you do lately ?""
A: ""I've been watching dog videos on youtube all day. Do you have a dog?""
B: ""Yeah, it is the reason why I clean to much the house. Dog hair everywhere. ""
A: ""Even with all the shedding, I wish I could have a dog of my own. My friend has a big dog and I get along with it really well.""
B: ""I would not give my dog for anything in the world. I love it very much. But I never suspected that it would need so much cleaning. I don't have time to watch dog videos on youtube. Do you plan to get a dog ?""
A: ""I would have to ask my parents for one soon. It would be a good replacement for a friend since none of the kids at school like me.""
B: ""You have your friend with a dog, he does not go to the same school as you ?""
A: ""No, he does not. I'm an outcast at my school. I hate it. At least I still have tennis that I enjoy. Do you still practice tennis as well?""

A: ""That sounds good. Maybe taking care of something like that would help me. And I'm good. I'm working as a baker--it just still hurts. I sometimes wonder if I'm not in the right field. Do you feel that way about working at Barnes and Noble? Is it satisfying, even though it isn't chemistry?""
B: ""It helps pay the bills and the discount definitely helps when it comes to textbooks. It sounds like a pet would give you a bit of a new lease on life. ""
A: ""Oh, that's a good point. Haha, the perk of being a baker is knowing how to bake! And that's true. I think that's what I'm looking for--more fullness in life. Maybe you should try that too--get more into dancing, like you've been talking about.""
B: ""That is so true, I do need to get out more but my coursework is very demanding. Maybe we could go together. ""
A: ""Oh, I feel you, there. I'm still taking courses, myself, just in case this whole baking thing isn't endgame. Do you think you'll go for another job, after more schooling?""
B: ""I plan to apply for job with a biotech company. I want to help find cures for the diseases that don't have them yet. Baking uses a lot of chemistry""
A: ""That sounds fantastic! That's really good stuff. Important stuff. I'm still figuring out what I want to do, but it might be something like that--that makes a difference. Maybe just tech security. Both stopping viruses, eh? Haha, well, I'll trade you some baking lessons for some help with my homework sometime. Definitely bring Larry by, too!""

B: ""I was going to, but it was taking so long waiting for each individual part to come in stock and then to beat the bots in actually buying it.

A: ""I totally understand, I'd definitely get it ready built too (especially as my electronic skills are basically zero). My wifi has been rubbish recently so I think that sometimes I'm probably the person in the loading screen getting killed immediately! ""

A: ""Haha it's the wifi box's fault, don't worry! The Aerosmith gig isn't until October. I can't wait to see some live music. Are you going to see any bands this year?""
B: ""Hopefully I can go to Gathering of the Juggalos and see ICP. I haven't been in a few years and I'm so excited to see some live music too!""
A: ""I ordered a new gaming PC from Digital Storm!  It actually was not as expensive as I was expecting, and they had some of the nicer NVIDIA GPU's in stock.""
B: ""That's great! Did you decide which RPG you want to break it in with?""
A: ""I still don't know. I quite liked the old elder scroll games from many years ago. Maybe I'll check out Skyrim.""
B: ""Maybe I'll start up Skyrim too, there's a mod out there that allows for multiplayer functionality so we could meet up. That is - if you can get your wifi issues worked out. It would drive me nuts to run a brand new machine on an unstable connection, is that your next goal? Or are you going to let the wifi be for a while?""
A: ""On the one hand I only have so much money and can't fix everything. But on the other hand what's the point of a brand new PC if I can't use it? In short it depends on if I have money.""
B: ""I think that's smart; definitely save your money for now. You can use the time without wifi to play it as it's meant to be played and to build a good foundation in the game. How long do you have to wait for the new PC to arrive?""
A: ""Just a week I think. Can't wait for it to arrive!""
B: ""I think you're going to be blown away; you'll wonder how you ever survived with your old laptop when you see how much better a new system will run. Will you need help getting everything set up?""
A: ""Yes I do! Is that an offer?""

B: ""Why do you get blue around the holidays?""
A: ""I managed to take a trip out to see the birds with my kitty, it was great fun!""
B: ""That sounds nice. Did you see any rare species while you were out bird watching?""
A: ""There is a bald eagle nest near my house which we went to visit.  Have you ever seen a baby bald eagle before? ""
B: ""Wow that's great. No I haven't seen any Eagles let alone a baby. That must be amazing to see out in the wild. are they dangerous?""
A: ""As long as you don't get to close they aren't too dangerous.  That's why binoculars are a birder's best friend! We watch from afar. ""
B: ""Well I was going to say isn't watching bird's with your cat a little bit dangerous for the birds? but to be honest I'm starting to worry for your cat LOL.""
A: ""My cat is lazy and doesn't like to walk on her own. I have a stroller for her.  She is totally spoiled! Do you have any pets? ""
B: ""You have a stroller for your cat?! that sounds so crazy. I think she is spoilt yes. I'd love a snake but by parents won't allow me to have one. As soon as I get a place of my own I'll definitely get onw. ""
A: ""She's my baby since my kiddos are grown now.  Snakes are interesting pets. I don't think I could feed a pet snake mice. But if you have the stomach for that, I'm sure they make fun pets.""
B: ""Yeah actually I know what you mean. I couldn't French a snake live mice. They would have to be captive bread frozen nice I think. I wouldn't get a large one, just a corn snake or something.""
A: ""I've never heard of a corn snake before. Sounds like you've put a lot of thought into getting a snake. I hope you can get one soon!""
B: ""Yeah me too! they are quite small snakes so quite easy to look after, at least that's what I've read.""
A: ""I've been doing some research and found more interesting bird watching spots near me. ""
B: ""Oh really? We should go bird watching together. I really want to see an eagle!""
A: ""That would be awesome! Are eagles your favorite animal?""
B: ""No, I like eagles but I've never even seen one. My favourite animal is a snake! I wish my parents would let me get a pet corn snake.""
A: ""A pet corn snake? That sounds crazy, why won't your parents let you get one.""
B: ""They don't think I'm responsible enough to look after it. It would need feeding live mice and to be honest I would hate to do that, so it would end up being my parents job to feed it!""
A: ""Oh I understand, I could not fathom feeding live mice to a snake. Maybe you will get one when you are living on your own?""
B: ""Doesn't your cat bring mice into the house? You must be used to gruesome sights like that. Yeah I might get a snake when I move out! I can't wait to move out, I will have so much more freedom! ""
A: ""Oh no! I treat my cat like my children, and they do not eat other animals. I would have a problem with my cat if they killed mice. I can't wait for you to be independent and free!""
B: ""You are lucky that your cat is not into catching things, because I don't think you'd be able to stop her! I know you don't eat meat, but for cats it is natural. I can't wait to be independent too! I am saving up as much money as I can from my job at Burger King.""
A: ""Slowly but surely, I am sure you'll get there soon!""
B: ""I will do! I hope it will be worth it - I'm not going on any holidays this year because I want to save the money. How about you, do you have any holidays planned this year?""
A: ""I did some research on the eagles by my house and found out the next month is the best time to watch them. They should be at the nest the majority of the time. ""
B: ""Are you serious? That's just wonderful. How are you going to watch them?""
A: ""I have a pair of binoculars, it is really nice observing them""
B: ""It must be thrilling watching eagles. I've never seen an eagle in person. I would definitely love to watch them.""
A: ""you can come over whenever you want, there are also quite a few snkes nearby""
B: ""Snakes! I love snakes. But I once watched a documentary on Nat Geo Wild. It said eagles eat snakes.""
A: ""That is why the snakes keep dissapearing! The eagles are like pest control for them!!""
B: ""It would really hurt me to see a snake get eaten by an eagle. How do the eagles even manage to eat the snakes? Do they have teeth?""
A: ""No, their talons latch onto a snake and kills the snake. IT eats the snake by swallowing it.""
B: ""Isn't the snake able to fight back?""
A: ""No, because the eagle would have killed the snake by then""

A: ""I would love to take my family to Italy for the summer. When did you go there last?""
B: ""It has been about a year or two since my last visit. You and your family should really try to visit Italy at least once. Venice, Rome, Naples you can't go wrong.""
A: ""We love Italian food and would go just to taste REAL italian cooking, haha. The sites would be a bonus. So being related to Columbus is why you enjoy sailing? A family love of the water?""
B: ""Maybe. I was raised around water so I developed a pretty natural affinity towards it. No idea if Columbus' genes are so strong that they would have compelled me to sail and travel if I was raised a bit differently.""
A: ""I was raised around water also but would much rather be on land. What kind of art are you studying in college?""
B: ""I'm learning about all different kinds at the moment to learn about various styles. Everything from Rembrandt to Picasso.""
A: ""That sounds amazing yet difficult. I think I will stick with learning more about gardening and the outdoors, haha. How much longer do you have in school?""
B: ""Only about a year or so left until I earn my bachelors. Gardening is a pretty nifty skills to have. Artistry is nice but it notoriously doesn't always put food on the table.""
A: ""When you earn your degree will you go on to teach others? Gardening gives an amazing feeling of accomplishment  for sure!""
B: ""I don't really plan to be a professor, at least not right away. I'll have to see where the future takes me.""

B: ""Not yet but I've been researching places to go in Switzerland and Austria as I love the Alps and it'll be close to get across to Italy. Have you been to Austria or Switzerland before?""

B: ""Yes I've heard it's beautiful too. I think I'll have to brush up on some Italian before I make the trip, as I haven't learnt any since I was in high school! I think we had to learn some French too, but I can't remember most of it now. Do you speak any other languages aside from English?""
A: ""I took Spanish in high school and then traveled to a few Spanish-speaking countries to practice, so I used to be quite good at Spanish, but I haven't used it recently.  I'll definitely need a refresher.  Have you heard of DuoLingo? That app helps you to learn languages.""
B: ""Oh that's great that you were able to practice in Spanish-speaking countries; I've heard that the best way to learn is to immerse yourself in the culture! Yes I have heard of Duolingo though I haven't used it before. Do you know if it is free?""
A: ""I used it years ago and it was free.  And yes, traveling definitely helped with my Spanish, but I may use the app as a refresher before I travel to Italy.  Any recommendations of things to do while in Italy if I bring my family there one day?""
B: ""Great, well I'll definitely look into Duolingo then. And as there's an app it'll be useful to do on my phone when I get a free moment! In terms of where to go in Italy, I'd recommend the area in the north around Lake Garda as it's just beautiful and there are lots of towns to visit. Tuscany is also lovely with all its rolling hills and vineyards. If your family is into art then Florence is good choice too!""
A: ""Thanks for all of those recommendations - that's really helpful!  I enjoy art, but my kids sometimes get bored by it.  What type of art are you most interested in?  I enjoy nature photography and painting.""
B: ""Ha yes I can imagine that the kids might get bored in art galleries! I also enjoy nature photography, and portrait photography too. I'm not very good at painting though! What type of painting do you do (e.g watercolor, acrylic etc)?""
A: ""I like oil painting the most, but I tend to use acrylics more often because the smell of the turpentine needed to get oil paint out of the brushes is really nasty! I don't want to use such a harsh chemical around the kids.""
B: ""I hadn't thought about how hard it must be to get oil paint out of a paintbrush, I can understand why you don't want to always have to get out the turpentine! What type of thing to you like to paint?""
A: ""Are you able to get study abroad credits for your travels? I imagine there has to be studying you can do related to art while you're abroad. ""
B: ""I think so. I'll have to look into it. ""
A: ""I am sure there are many places in Europe that have so many museums and what not. I would advise that Australia isn't really a place for art though haha. ""
B: ""You don't think so? I still think it would be fun to travel there for a bit. ""
A: ""Oh definitely. Make sure you are ready to see the outback. It is an amazing, yet terrifying thing. I want to go again, but not until my kids are old enough to be out of the house. I know that even if they don't have great art, you can get some amazing photos there!""
B: ""I love taking photos. I want to get a picture with some koalas and kangaroos. ""
A: ""Oh yeah, those would be great, just don't get too close to the kangaroos. They tend to be friendly to a point, and can be aggressive. If you get really lucky, you might get some good shots of dessert snakes or crocs. They are beautiful, and the lighting there is really unlike anything I have ever seen.

B: ""I like nature photography. just love the scenery and the animals. ""
A: ""Have you ever considered going to the Amazon? I hear that the scenery is amazing, but I am kind of nervous about all the bugs and disease that way. I wanted to go when I was younger, but big cats are scarier than kangaroos. ""

A: ""I think about my dolls! Hahaha, I think about mashing them around and ripping them up! It's so much fun, and it gets me so excited! So, I'm usually really excited and happy when I run. You should think about what makes you excited, too! Like soccer! Just pretend you're running for the ball.""

A: ""I am currently in school to become a nurse.""
B: ""Ahhh. Well, I love to knit, my grandma had taught me to knit since I was little!""
A: ""That is a great hobby. What do you do for a job?""
B: ""Well, when I have spare time, I always help out at the county wide bake sale.""
A: ""I wish I knew how to bake. I can cook soup well.""
B: ""Same, I try to present the cookies I can to the sale.""
A: ""How were the cookies you made last week?""
B: ""They were delicious, thank you. I made some chocolate chip cookie dough and I freeze it in individual cookie shapes. That night, I only cooked two for me. then I won't over eat. Do you like cookies and if you do, what kind is you favorite?""
A: ""Yes I like cookies, chocolate chip are my favorite. How long did it take you to make them?""
B: ""I take the amount i want out of the freezer and bake them for about a minute longer than if I baked them from unfrozen. About 13 min. I watch them so they won't  burn. How has work been?""
A: ""It's been busy, but I like busy. It makes the time fly. How's your worbeen?""
B: ""I had a lot of overtime this week at the office. My dog was missing me. You mentioned that you may get a dog next spring, what kind of dog are you wanting?""
A: ""I would like to get a golden doodle. I had one years ago and he was great. How old is your dog?""
B: ""Gabriel is 3. I have seen those golden doodles in pictures but I have yet to see one in person. I hope you find a reputable breeder to get the dog. Do you think there is a long waiting list?""
A: ""I don't think so. I'll have to find out. What kind of things do you like to knit?""
B: ""I am currently working on a sweater dress. I saw the pattern about 2 years back and I saved it until I felt confident to try. I am making it a smokey grey and I hope to be done by next winter. I bet your work and college leave little time for hobbies. What kind of hobbies do you like or wish to do?'""
A: ""I like cooking and golfing. Don't get much golfing in though. Hopefully soon thought.""
B: ""It is a great time of year to golf, I hope you get to do that soon""
A: ""How is Gabriel doing, do you cook his food as well?""
B: ""I believe I cooked it well, he ate it faster than he normally eats his food. Must have been a success. ""
A: ""Well that's good to hear. I meant to ask you for a simple baking recipe if you could recommend one? I want to branch out a little from only eating cookies.""
B: ""It is always good to branch out. I would love to send you a recipe. What type of food is your favorite?""
A: ""Anything sweet is good for me! But bear in mind the only thing I know how to cook is soup, so when I say the recipe needs to be basic I mean... *basic*, ha.""
B: ""How about a good croc pot recipe to start off? You throw all the items in the pot, turn it on and stir occasionally? ""
A: ""Oh I meant a dessert recipe! I'd like to branch out into cooking something sweet. I love cookies, so maybe I should start there unless that's too complex?""
B: ""I have a great 3 layered brownie recipe or I have a croc pot cake recipe. I can send you both and you can try with those first. ""
A: ""Sounds awesome, then I have both courses taken care of! Thanks so much. I'd starve without you, lol""
B: ""Glad I can help with your cooking needs! Hopefully you share with your roommate. How is school going?""
A: ""Going well thankyou! But so busy. Maybe that's why I'm itching for a new recipe - sick to death of living off ramen!""
B: ""I can imagine that gets old rather quickly. But once you become a nurse it will surely be worth it. ""
A: ""Have you ever knitted a sweater for Gabriel? Or would he get too hot wearing a sweater?""
B: ""Oh he has several sweaters I've knitted, for winter-wear of course. I also bake home-made dog treats for him, he's very spoiled. So have you found a dog of your own yet? ""
A: ""nice. Home made dog treats is awesome. You ever thought about selling them?""
B: ""Do you think anyone would want to buy them? I'd put them in the county bake sale but I fear someone would mistake them for people cookies - you know people don't read or pay attention much these days. ""
A: ""Oh course they will. I would buy them if I had a dog. I am still looking for a Golden Doodle. I want to learn to bake. I only enjoy cookies though. ""
B: ""Well I do make a mean cookie. I'd be happy to share some recipes with you. I do hope you're able to find a dog soon, they make such lovely companions. Shiba's are a bit stubborn but Gabriel is very sweet when he wants to be.  ""
A: ""If you could share some recipes with me I would greatly appreciate it.   I was just thinking. I might have to get to the county bake sale and watch a person eat one of your dog treats. that would be picture worthy haha""
B: ""Oh that would be terrible! Funny though. I hope you're not too lonely dear. Are you keeping up with your golfing? ""
A: ""I haven't been lately. My golf buddy has been ditching me lately. He has a new friend in his life. Maybe we can go golfing sometime. If you can get out of work. I know you usually do a lot of overtime""
B: ""You'd have to teach me, I've never played. I do have my father's old golf clubs though. And afterward maybe we could bake cookies. I know how much you love chocolate chip. ""
A: ""Oh I would be more than happy to show you how to golf. if you promise me not only will you bake me some chocolate cookies. You have to give me the recipe. Speaking of recipes you have to tell me more about this croc pot cake? that pot can make anything now I see""
B: ""Oh you can do almost anything in a crock pot or an instant pot. I also have a great recipe for instant pot cheesecake. If you don't have an instant pot I have a spare smaller one I can give you. ""

A: ""Oh nice. Do you like it there? I am actually chatting from a juvenile detention center.""
B: ""It is a job for now. I really prefer working with plants and gardening.""
A: ""Ah, I understand. I wish I had thought like you before I decided to shoplift.""
B: ""How long do you have to stay in the center? My parents would kill me.""
A: ""I am here for another month. My parents were pretty upset about the whole thing.""

A: ""I spoke to someone else in the detention center about gardening and I want to tell you about it. ""
B: ""Really? I'm surprised someone in the detention center knows about gardening. What did they say?""
A: ""They said it is just like shoplifting in a way, where there is little room for success.""
B: ""I don't agree with you at all. Shoplifting is wrong - it can never be called a success. Gardening has unlimited potential - it's amazing to see new life growing and changing every day. I'd call that success.""

A: ""Oh, all the time. I'm a huge internet junkie. Facebook, twitter, etc.""
B: ""I never got into twitter, probably because I'm a little older than 30.""
A: ""Not much of an internet person?""
B: ""I can be sometimes but mostly facebook. I post a lot of picture of my dogs.""

B: ""I have two dogs. Do you have any pets?""
A: ""No, I cannot afford pets right now. Organic pet food is super expensive.""

A: ""What activities do you like to do around your city?""
B: ""Taking my dogs out to the local dog parks has been fun for me. It lets me meet other people that also have dogs. Plus my city is pretty walkable so I like to go on walks with the dogs. How about you? Do you get out to walk much in your city?""
A: ""I do get a bit of spare time every now and then to take a walk outside. There's a lot of trails around my house that are good to take, and they can be very scenic.""
B: ""Same here. The Pacific Northwest is very pretty -especially when the weather is nice. I try to go hiking pretty often actually.""
A: ""That sounds like fun, I wish some of my friends were more into hiking. Although my family loves hiking, so it’s not too bad. Do you take your dogs with you when you go hiking? ""
B: ""Only sometimes. It's hard terrain for my older dog to navigate, so mostly they get confined to just neighborhood walks or the dog park. My family are not hikers at all so I tend to hike solo. Do you ever post your hikes for your work?""
A: ""Of course, I love to keep my followers updated with what I am doing in a given day. Posting hikes seem like a no brainer as well, as many of my followers are into fitness and would love to learn more about what they can do in my city.""

A: ""The food, attractions, and other sights to see. I would say that my followers are always especially interested in new restaurants or interesting dishes.""
B: ""I bet that keeps you pretty busy - going to new places and keeping on top of all the trends in your area. Are you adventurous with what you will eat then at the new restaurants? I'm mostly a basic burger and fries kind of person...no quinoa for me.""
A: ""I do try to get something new every time I go to a restaurant, but I don't mind going to a local place to get some burgers and fries.""
B: ""My younger niece is just 10 but she is already a ""foodie""...I think it's all the Food Network shows she watches. How about your kids? Are they down to try new foods too?""
A: ""This restaurant near me just released this crazy new milkshake that is all sorts of colors and candy and flavors; they're calling it the ""Magical Rainbow Unicorn Big Yum Yum"". Super unhealthy, but I decided to try it for interesting new social media content and it was awful! My kids are taking turns drinking it now though. ""
B: ""Oh yeah, I bet kids would love something like that. I am not sure I would be into trying it at all. I like caramel milkshakes though.""
A: ""I really like chocolate strawberry or chocolate caramel milkshakes. But I think it is just too much sugar when you start adding more stuff to it.""
B: ""Yeah, that sounds way better than all the extra stuff. Have you ever tried anything like it before?""
A: ""not exactly like it, but I do like to try new and interesting foods at least once. It's good content for my social media pages. ""
B: ""How many followers do you have on there? I don't think I could get a lot of people interested even if I really liked being on social media because my life is kind of boring. Though, I could post photos of my dogs all day and not even care if everyone got tired of it.""
A: ""I have around 2000. trying to increase followers. But I bet you could get a good following just posting about your dogs. people love dogs!""
B: ""Maybe I will try that. Not that I care if I get followers, but I love taking photos of my pups. The older one lets me dress her in outfits, and the puppy likes to do crazy things that are so funny. Like she chases a laser light and if you make it go up the wall she will run into it.""
A: ""That's hilarious. people absolutely love silly pets and dogs wearing clothes. if you get enough of a following you can actually make money by posting""
B: ""I never realized it could generate income while having fun. Maybe I should try it out and maybe I could enjoy it more. Thanks for the advice. ""

A: ""Max is a very nice name! We do have big deer here, I see them quite often in the woods surrounding my parents' farm. Where do you usually go hiking at?""
B: ""I undwind after a hard week at the office by going to my cabin by the lake.  It is at the foot of the South Axe Mountain.  Do the deer eat your crops?   ""
A: ""Wow, that sounds very nice. I like to unwind by driving my truck around town, but if I enjoyed the outdoors more I would probably like to relax at a cabin like that. The deer are actually quite timid. They usually don't come close to the farm, and they mostly eat the berries and shrubs that grow in the woods.""
B: ""Really? I have always heard that farmers have a hard time keeping the deer out of the crops.  ""
A: ""Yup, the ones around here are not bothersome, which is quite nice. I think they get scared off from all of the loud noises the farm equipment makes. Are there lots of deer in Colorado too?""
B: ""Well I guess it's a good thing they are scared of tractors and such! Yeah I see them quite often around here.    ""
A: ""It is a good thing for us! What other kinds of wildlife have you come across on your hikes? I've heard Colorado has a ton of wild animals.""
B: ""oh yeah, turkeys, goats, bears, mountain lions.  You name it and we've got it.  That's one of the things I love about my state.  But tell me about the animals on your family farm.""
A: ""Wow, such a wide variety! Very cool. We mostly grow crops on the farm, but we do raise chickens and a handful of cattle. The fresh eggs and milk make it all worth it.""
A: ""I went outside today and i want to tell you about all the wildlife I came across. ""

A: ""I might, will help my parents in the morning.""
B: ""Nice. Are you helping with the crops?""
A: ""Is photographing wildlife your hobby or do you just enjoy watching them without taking pictures? ""
B: ""Both really. I love to go out and take photos, but sometimes, I just need to be in nature with no electronics or other people. It is nice to get out with Max and just enjoy being alive. When was the last time you went out just to enjoy nature?""
A: ""I work on the farm a lot. that's outside and the cattle and chickens count as nature, right?""
B: ""I mean, yeah they do. If you are out in it not just in the stables, corral and coop lol. Do you do the round up? That definitely counts as nature. I went on one once, and I saw the most amazing things.""
A: ""well we do spend a bit of time working in the stables and the coop but we do get out in the field to get work done as well. ""
B: ""What about driving your truck on country roads? That is kind of like enjoying nature. I only like driving on country roads, preferably dirt ones. I often stop in random places just to walk around.""
A: ""driving on country roads is pretty relaxing. it's nice to get away from it all and just get lost driving.""
B: ""Yeah it is. Max loves feeling the wind on his face, and he even tolerates me blasting music when I am in a mood. I usually keep it somewhat low to protect his ears, but some days, I just gotta unwind. Ya know?""
A: ""definitely. what's the coolest wildlife you have come across on your drives?""
B: ""I have seen a lot of Elk, but the best thing ever was when I accidentally came across a bald eagle nest. There were babies!""
A: ""Oh wow, that's awesome. I would love to see something like that. ""
B: ""I didn't have my camera that day or I would forward you a photo of it. I knew they lived in the area, but I never thought I would get to see one. Especially not stumbling upon it in a random stop to clear my head. I am glad Max didn't try to go visit them.""

B: ""If I share that with you, it could mean trouble for the both of us. Ask your father, I'm sure he recalls how secretive these operations can be. Speaking of which, how are the horses doing? I know that operation was stressful on them and the farm.  ""
A: ""They are doing okay now, but one of them is actually pregnant! You have any experience with pregnant animals?""
B: ""Oh wow! That is great news! I dont have any experience with pregnant horses. We dont have any horses on the moon because of the gravity situation. Are you still able to them in that condition? ""
A: ""My horse that was pregnant had her foal, it's a girl!""
B: ""Congratulations, and that sounds lovely. I hope the mom and foal are bonding well. Love how short their baby tails are! Do they have a name yet? ""
A: ""No not yet. This is the first arabian horse born on my farm and I think the pressure of the right name is getting to me! I'm sure it'll come eventually. How has work been this week?""
B: ""Work is kind of scheduled, I have to follow a checklist. Exciting sometimes. Feeling a little tired today. I don't know much about horses, so I get curious with  your horses. ""
A: ""You'll have to come over and see them sometime. They all just got a full wash and cut so those tails look amazing. Even the little baby one looks majestic! Might be a nice boost for your soul, if you're tired.""
B: ""Horses are just beautiful to look at, and have strong personalities.Maybe I do need to get to see a few horses. Maybe the horses help with your farm?""
A: ""Yes and no - they definitely help me pull anything really heavy, but they also create a lot of work and cost a lot of money, so we'll call it even! Horses are so gentle and soothing to be around, I find.""
B: ""Definitely, a lot of work and money go into maintaining them, stable fees, feed and vet fees, oh yes. It's good when your job can kind of subsidize or pay for your hobbies! Wonder if you would be good at horse training. ""
A: ""I've always wondered that myself. I guess we'll find out with this new horse, eh? All my arabians came to me fully trained and show-ready, so if this little one turns out to be a terror I guess we'll know I'm terrible at training!""
B: ""Nature versus nurture I guess. I tend to read and research when I'm building skills. Arabians are beautiful too. Sometimes I have to be careful about sharing what I do for work. I enjoy it though. ""
A: ""Better to be safe than sorry, right? As long as you enjoy it, that's what matters.""
B: ""And sometimes we grow and change. Wonder if you knew 10 years ago, you'd have all these horses, and be a recent horse foal caretaker! ""
A: ""So, as it turns out -- training horses isn't very easy! The new foal wants nothing to do with me. All she wants to do is stand in the field and eat dandelions. ""
B: ""Oh no, are those bad for them? Would you train foals? I figured they would need to be older before people started getting on them.""
A: ""You don't ride them as a baby, but you still get them started with training with the lead and all that.""

B: ""Ah. That is a tough bet. I do not follow sports.""
A: ""These open poly relationships can be so complicated. I think mine is breaking apart. Have you had that happen?""
B: ""I have had that happen before. Poly relationships are extremely complicated to make them work for long periods of time. How long have you been in this poly relationship?""
A: ""My relationship has been going on for about 3 months now. It's still really new and we're just trying to work everything out and establish boundaries and such. What about your relationship?""
B: ""Setting boundaries is the most important foundation in my opinion. Also, as much as you are comfortable communicating, you should be. My relationship has been going on for about a year. We have had our ups and downs as well. Nobody is perfect! I am very curios, when was the last time you went swimming naked?""
A: ""A year!? Well, congrats to you then. That's incredible. The last time I went swimming naked? Hmm... About a week ago, actually. Nothing is more freeing and calming, honestly. ""
B: ""Thank you! Hey my hats off to you for having that kind of bravery. I still don't think I could bring myself to swim naked. What bet did you lose to make you go swimming naked for the first time?""
A: ""My partner and I made a bet about who could run the fastest mile. We were working out together one day and were just fooling around. Well, I lost the bet and had to swim naked later that night! ""

A: ""Haha, well nude beaches are a great place to start the naked swimming journey! Everyone there is named and no one will look twice at you!

B: ""Despite my poly relationship, I still have some hang-ups left over from being raised in a conservative family. I'm sure I'll work past them though, I just need to take it slow. How does your dad feel about your relationship? He sounds cooler than my parents""

B: ""I haven't been hiking in so long. Don't think the cats would go for it.""
A: ""Haha, if you ever wanted to go for a hike I could let my dogs look after your cats.  I think they might change their mind pretty quickly when faced with some along time with my pups.""
B: ""Haha! They would certainly prefer hiking at that point, I think. What kind of dogs do you have?""
A: ""One's a German shepherd, and the other is a lab-mix that I got from the shelter.  I still don't fully know what he is actually, but that's okay.  What makes you prefer cats over dogs?""
B: ""I just think they're hilarious. I actually prefer Siamese cats. That's what all five of mine are. And in my opinion, they all act like dogs!""
A: ""Wow, I don't think I've ever seen a Siamese cat in person before.  I can see how they'd be pretty unique and cool.  But I just love how active my dogs are, and I don't see how I could ever do so many things outdoors if I had cats.""

A: ""What types of things do you enjoy doing with your cats? ""
B: ""My 5 Siamese cats and I have some fun adventures together. I take them on fishing trips with me, and sometimes we just hang out on the beach. Sometimes, we'll watch a local team play a ball game at the park.""
A: ""Wow! That's pretty cool. How do you keep them under control outside?""
B: ""They're well-behaved and don't act out much. They love the attention from other people, too. Come summertime, though, they might get cranky when it's blistering hot outside.""
A: ""Yes,  my dogs don't like the heat either. I guess it's the fur. Luckily, they like water, so we go hiking near lakes and rivers. It cools them off. Are your cats on leashes outside or in carriers or just free to roam?""
B: ""I keep them on leashes so they don't run away to find a new and improved owner. Ha! I think they know that when we go fishing, they'll be enjoying a lovely fish or crab dinner, so they play along with it. Have you been on any outdoor adventures with your German Shepard and labrador recently?""
A: ""Yes, I would think leashes would work best. They must eat really well after one of your fishing trips! Me and the dogs went hiking last weekend. We had a wonderful time. I think they know when it's the weekend and we can play. ""
B: ""That sounds like it was fun. Do your dogs like seafood, too? What kind of seafood have you been cooking up?""
A: ""They like it okay. They're dogs after all! They pretty much eat anything. It's hard to find fresh fish and seafood where I live, so I don't cook it much. BBQs and tacos are my staples. I love tacos. Do you have a good taco place where you are?""

B: ""Nah you aren't getting old. You aren't old until you hit 60 in my opinion haha. My school is going well I have been able to keep my grades up. I actually plan on going kayaking soon during spring break to treat myself for my hard work. ""
A: ""That's wonderful! Keep up the good work! I are so close to being done.  I am sure kayaking and being outdoors will help you relieve some stress. You told me about kayaking before. I really need to try it. ""
B: ""I would love to take you kayaking with me sometime if you ever want to! You had mentioned you have never been camping before either. I'll make you a deal. I will be happy to take you into the outdoors for some adventures. In return, will you show me what a Lite Brite is and how to use it?""
A: ""I would love that! We have a deal! I will bring Light Bright with me.  The activity is really relaxing and you can do it while camping.  I will have to talk to you before we go though. I have no idea what to pack with me. ""
B: ""Is lite brite something similar to crafting a piece of art? I could use some practice on my creativity I think. Before we go camping, give me a call and I'll help you go through my own personal checklist of what to pack!""
A: ""Light Bright is a very old toy, I think from the 60s. It includes pegs and a light box. You can be very creative and create a really fun art.""
B: ""That is different from anything I have heard of before I can't wait to try it! Do you have a collection of lite brite art work you could show me sometime? I would love to see your masterpieces!""
A: ""I ordered you your very own Lite Brite and you should get it this week.""
B: ""That's great. I can't wait to play with it. Any thing i should know about it?""
A: ""Not that I can think of off the top of my head, but if you have any questions when it arrives please don't hesitate! I'm so excited for you. I can't believe you never had one growing up!""
B: ""I've seen some commercials and retro shows that have shown them, but have never had one. ""
A: ""They're really easy to use. You'll love it, I promise. And it makes such a relaxing environment which I'm sure you need for all that studying. How's school going?""
B: ""Grad school is intense. I can't wait to be done and get out in the real world and practice what i've learned. Maybe you can be my first patient lol""
A: ""Lol don't even joke, I really will be the way my brain's been racing at 3am! Maybe a good camping trip would do me good. Get out in nature and stuff. Have you ever been?""
B: ""Yes. I actually went kayaking this past week and had a few nights stay in the wilderness.""
A: ""Oh really?! Kayaking looks like so much fun and I'd love to try it, but it also kind of scares me. What happens if you go fast and tip over and oh my goodness I'm hyperventilating just thinking about it""
B: ""It's scary at first, but you get used to it. You need to try it. You will love it.""
A: ""I'll try it if you come with me? I need to know that someone I'm with is calm even if it all goes wrong, and then I'll be fine, lol.""
B: ""Let's do it. You will have the time of your life. ""
A: ""Did you set up your new Lite Brite?""
B: ""Yes, I'm having a blast with it. I love vintage toys, I'm thinking of finding a monster-maker soon. So what has you so stressed out these days?  ""
A: ""A lot of the stress is just adulting. I'm stressed with the job and the mortgage.  I guess I need a vacation. ""
B: ""Adulting is hard. Grad school has been kicking my butt, I'm not sure how I'm managing to keep my grades up, seems like I'm always studying. You should definitely take a little vacation, maybe get out in nature. ""
A: ""How much longer do you have left in Grad school?""
B: ""Another year, then I'll have to find an internship. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get a full nights sleep again. ""
A: ""It will pay off in the end. Just keep of the good work. Do you want to start your own practice or work for someone else?""
B: ""One of my college friends and I are thinking about a partnership, or opening up a rural clinic in an underserved area. So, what about that vacation? Have you thought about where you might like to go?""
A: ""I would like to go to the beach. The beach seems to calm everything!""
B: ""Now that's what you need. Sitting on the shore under an umbrella, sipping pina coladas and listening to the waves. That would lower your stress significantly. ""
A: ""Yes it would. Thanks for encouraging my thoughts! I really need this!""
B: ""I hope you get to do it soon! I can't really escape my own stress right now but maybe even an afternoon hike might help. ""

B: ""Yes, two boys and a girl. So I'm going to have my hands full! ""
A: ""I bet you will. Have you thought about potential names already?""
B: ""Not so much. My husband and I can't agree. I tend to be traditional, and he wants something 'unique'. Do you think you'd like children some day?""
A: ""'Unique' LOL. I feel bad some times for these kids with very 'cool' names. Go figure how uncomfortable it can get when they're young adults and looking for a job. I don't see myself as a mom to be honest""
B: ""I agree exactly! Why not a strong reliable name that's been around forever. I think it's great that you know your heart when it comes to children. There's a lot of pressure, and not every woman needs to become a mother. ""
A: ""RIGHT? I agree with you on both counts. Being a mother is huge responsibility and I fully commend you for it. I feel I can do a better job as the cool auntie haha ""
B: ""That's amazing. Well I'm sure going to need a cool auntie or two once this lot is born! Plus you've got so many amazing hobbies. I wish I could play violin. ""
A: ""Funny you mention that. When my sister-in-law was in her last month of pregnancy she stayed at my place while I was just learning the violin. That meant I was playing it almost daily. Her son always smiles at me when he hears me playing even if he's only 2 years old ""
B: ""That's such a sweet story. You must have had some natural talent, as I imagine some of those early sounds are tough on the ears! One day I'd love to learn the cello It has such a deep mournful sounds. ""
A: ""I always joke that he smiles not because he remembers I played while he was still in the womb, but rather because I'm no longer hurting his ears LOL. Cello is nice, I have thought about learning it one day too""
B: ""LOL! I suspect if you're skilled with violin and guitar, you won't have any difficulty picking up cello. Me on the other hand will be starting at zero. ""
A: ""How is the pregnancy going? Have you been able to get enough rest?""
B: ""I don't think parents ever get enough rest, and carrying 3 babies can keep anyone from getting comfortable. Maybe in like 18 ish years?""
A: ""You're keeping a sense of humor, that's good. I want things to go well, healthy mom and kids for sure. And maybe you'll end up with a few friends who want to spoil your kids too. ""
B: ""Oh yeah, usually there are lots of people wanting to see new babies, but they tend to disappear after the new baby smell wears off. Maybe I will be a lucky one. If I make it through delivery, I am hoping a few of my people stick around. I am not certain how feeding three babies at once even works. I am so scared.""
A: ""Your feelings make sense, it's going to be a big transition. Sounds like you have a lot to consider. I prefer child free living, and support those that have kids too. ""
B: ""Well, you are welcome to play with the babies any time. I don't mind sharing my kids. I joked about putting them in a play pen and sitting outside walmart to auction them off haha. But I already love all three.""
A: ""There are probably a few parents that would love to discuss surrogate pregnancies. It's your body, your choice. Let me know about the next auction, I'll bring potluck. ""
B: ""Bahahahah That would be amazing. I would never want to be a surrogate. Pregnancy is not worth doing just to give up the life you hurt to grow. But I applaud those who can handle it. What would you bring to a baby auction potluck lol""
A: ""I was trying to figure that out hehe. At first I thought beer, but then thought that might not be good for the kids. Then thought about bring popcicles... yeah don't know yet. Cookies might do! hehe. ""
B: ""I guess any of those things would work. But I don't know if walmart would appreciate such a display. It is fun to joke about crazy things that I can't actually do. I am sure there will be plenty of days where I want to do just what we are discussing. Parenthood is hard enough with my step kids.""
A: ""Sounds like it gives you plenty to be aware of, I hear you. Sometimes jokes help people cope with tough stuff. I love a good comedian, making me laugh. Some comedians too, like Stephen Colbert, inform, and make you laugh. You like any comedian? ""

B: ""Wow! I used to play the violin too. What age did you start playing?""
A: ""I started playing when I was 6! My parents asked which instrument I wanted to learn. It was either that or piano so I chose violin because I though it looked fun. I love it! What activities do you enjoy with your step kids? I need ideas for my nephew. ""
B: ""That's so early! I really like to play board games with them. I also enjoy doing things like going to the movies and going to the park and the zoo. What about you? What do you like to do as an aunt?""
A: ""We mostly stay home and play in the yard. I bet he'd love the zoo though! He's starting to learn animal names and sounds. ""
B: ""The zoo is so fun. He really would probably love the zoo. Have you thought about teaching your nephew ping pong?""
A: ""No, not yet. He'd probably have a hard time hitting the ball, it's pretty small. Teaching him guitar right now and he struggles to sit still enough to even hold it haha. ""
B: ""That is a really good idea to teach him music. Have you taught your nephew to speak Chineese?""

A: ""Yes, I honestly cannot wait to finish my nursing degree. I know I will be dealing with way more serious issues than cranky customers, but at least it is something I am passionate about.

B: ""That's amazing! It's really relaxing to be outside in the garden. Have you checked the library for books on gardening? I know you don't read but that may help some. ""
A: ""There are some audio books in the library, two on gardening but they're checked out. I have them on reserve for when they come back. so how are things at the museum? ""
B: ""Things are good! We have been getting a lot of field trips this month, it's been fun teaching kids new things. ""
A: ""That does sound fun. When I get out of here I'd love to visit the museum where you work. Did you finish the parenting book? What are you reading now?  ""
B: ""I did! I haven't decided what to read next. I've been thinking about reading The Power of Now. It's another self-help book.""
A: ""Maybe I can find some self help stuff on audio books, you seem to think those are helpful. Or maybe my mom could bring me some when she finally comes to visit.  ""
B: ""Oh ya, when is she coming? Are you nervous or excited? ""
A: ""I'm looking forward to it mostly, and maybe a little nervous. She can be judgmental sometimes, but I know she loves me. I just have to avoid solitary until then or I'll lose privileges. But now that I'm getting outside more I think I'll be less stressed. ""
B: ""That's good. Ya, I think being outside will definitely help! The outdoors is a natural stress-reliever. ""
A: ""It really is, and so is learning new things like gardening. If I keep my mind and body busy I won't be so upset all the time. ""
B: ""Exactly! And on top of that, you're being productive by helping in the garden. It's a nice feeling. ""

A: ""Really sound like hard work. Is it?""
B: ""Yeah, but I wrestle professionally. And work out a few times a week""
A: ""What kind of foods do you like? Because I love food.""
B: ""I like pizza, and I enjoy socializing. Being around people""
A: ""Really me too. And I travel all around the world to eat new foods.""

A: ""Me to. By the way, what are your dreams.""
B: ""My family being safe and unharmed""
A: ""Wow that is a really nice dream.""
B: ""Yea it sure is very much so!""
A: ""How did your time go volunteering at the homeless shelter?""
B: ""It went well, but I always feel a little sad seeing all of those people in need. Especially with this snow we have been having, it's been a rough go for them. But it is definitely rewarding and helps me put things into perspective and realize that I am lucky for everything that I have.""
A: ""What type of homeless shelter do you work at? ""
B: ""It's a local shelter for women and children escaping domestic violence. They come to us when they have nowhere else to go, but at least they are safe.""
A: ""That is so nice of you to take time to care for those who don't have any other options. Maybe you can host a fundraiser for the shelter to raise some money to help those in need. You could do a pizza dinner for families and have little workout themed games for the children.""
B: ""Wow, that is an amazing idea! I am not sure why I have never thought of something like that, but I think it could make a huge difference. Do you have experience in running fundraisers?""
A: ""Unfortunately I have not hosted any fundraisers of my own, but being the social butterfly that I am, I have attended a bunch of them.""
B: ""I have never really attended any myself so I am somewhat unfamiliar with the process. Maybe I can recruit you to help me out with it? I am not sure if you are interested in adding any volunteer work to your plate, so no pressure.""

A: ""I am looking up pizza recipes and considering having a pizza party before I leave for my trip. ""
B: ""That would be so fun! Usually people just order takeout for a pizza party, so it will be fun to actually make your own.""
A: ""I've never made my own, but I think it would be cool to try. Do you have any tips for me?""
B: ""I think it would be fun to set up a ""pizza bar"" and have everyone be able to make their own personal sized pizza and top it however they like! So have a bunch of little bowls with chopped up veggies, pepperoni, etc. ""
A: ""I think that's a good idea. It's unique and a good way to start off my trip to Europe. I need to get your expertise on Europe!""
B: ""I am getting so excited for you! Which countries are you planning to visit?""
A: ""England, Scotland, Ireland, Italy, and Spain. I hope to go to more, but those are the hot spots I want to see. ""

A: ""I need to hear about them then. My main goal is drink at a pub and try the local cuisine. ""
B: ""You should maybe join a bus tour on the ""Wild Atlantic Way"". It travels all down the coast, so you see some incredibly beautiful scenery and stop by all the local pubs and quaint restaurants with fresh and rustic food.""

A: ""I play the violin! But I enjoy farming and things like that, our family isn't traditional by any means. My sister has an interesting job most of the family hates.""
B: ""I remember, yeah. How is she going? Do you think she'll decide to switch careers? It must be hard for her to face a lot of judgment.""
A: ""She's doing alright, I don't think she will. She finds it empowering and honestly I'm just happy for her because it's a lot of money and she doesn't mind doing it. More power to her.""
B: ""Definitely! I mean honestly I wouldn't want my daughters doing that kind of work, but only because people would make it so hard for them... I'm glad your sister has you in her corner.""

B: ""I still have not decide if I have the time to learn the guitar, how much time do you practice violin each day ?""
A: ""I try to squeeze in at least 4 hours.  Two hours of exercises and two hours working on a specific piece.  I'd love to have more time for it.  I wouldn't worry too much about what time ou have.  Any time you can get learning music is worthwhile.""
B: ""Yeah, But I have a family to care for, a dog to walk, a job and football to watch. I think I don't have time for guitar, even a few minutes. How do you perform at work if you practice 4 hours per day ?""
A: ""I just try to compartmentalize my life.   Of course, I don't have daughters and a dog to care for.  I'm sure it makes it hard on you. Sounds like your life is even more hectic than mine!""
B: ""I think it is because I love what I do, so I don't find find it hectic. I am just very occupied at doing what I love. How do you like your job ? ""
A: ""It's a job. Pays the bills. I wish I could love my job the way my sister does hers.  I'd rather be playing music to be honest.""
B: ""Have you thought about making money by playing the violin ? Just a little money could enable you to work part-time and have more time for violin. ""
A: ""I wonder if there is a way you could take guitar lessons with your daughter? I know you want to spend time with them, which makes it hard to learn guitar, so maybe you can combine spending time with her AND also learn the guitar!""
B: ""That's a great idea!  Where can I take good guitar lessons at in Oregon?""
A: ""Well, you have the Oregon Music Academy, the School of Rock, and the Eliason School of Music all in Portland, Oregon. You can try those.""

A: ""It is the name of a movie starring Jack Black. I don't think it has any relation to the movie, though. Are you close to Portland?""
B: ""Yeah, I'm in Tigard Oregon.  I've heard that Portland is like the Nashville of the West Coast?""
A: ""I'm not sure, as I'm really not into country music. I'd much rather listen to Beethoven, Mozart, or Tchaikovsky. When you start playing guitar, will you be interested in playing rock, blues, jazz, or country?""
B: ""I want to play heavy metal.  Metallica and Iron maiden for life, baby!  You've never played the guitar?""
A: ""No, I haven't. Besides the violin, I can also play the piano. I'm more of an easy-listening music fan. You strike me as the macho type. You love football and loud guitars!""
B: ""Yeah, I'm a true man.  Beer, guns, and heavy metal!!!!  What got you into classical music anyways?""

B: ""Maybe when I get more energy. With my heart transplant, I do a lot of sleeping. Stealing treats is the only fun I have. ""
A: ""The vet gave my dog a clean bill of health!""
B: ""That is amazing news. I am always worried something bad will happen to Jerome one day.""
A: ""I know right! I breathed a huge sigh of relief when I first heard the news.  How has Jerome been lately?""
B: ""He has been much better. I have been training him so that he does not chew everything in the house anymore.""

B: ""They must be getting old then. Do you plan on having any more dogs when they have gone? I am really excited about getting another puppy soon.""

B: ""I know what you mean. If I did not have my dog I think I would easily be able to work a second job with the spare time. I have been looking at something small like a Chihuahua. ""
A: ""Aww, having a little Chihuahua with a big golden lab like Jerome is going to look so cute! Are you worried at all about the two dogs getting along with each other?""
B: ""Yes, I am a little worried. However, Jerome has calmed down lots since we started training him. I would be more worried about the little dog causing trouble. ""
A: ""I asked my husband about how he trained our dogs not to chew things in the house. He recommends lots of chew toys and every time you catch Jerome chewing on something he isn't supposed to chew on, removing it and then replacing it with a chew toy. ""
B: ""That old boy Jerome is driving me crazy chewing furniture, clothes, and other stuff. I think I'll try using the chew toys like your husband recommends.""
A: ""Yes, try it out and let me know how it goes. How does your mom feel about all the chaos that comes with Jerome?""

B: ""I'm much better, thanks for asking. With my heart, I'm healthier than I've ever been. I just have to watch what I eat and I've given up smoking for good. We'd love some fresh baked cookies. Also, I'd be willing to pay you to knit a sweater for Jerome.""
A: ""I didn't know you were a smoker, how long have you been smoking? I am happy to hear you have given it up. I will make some cookies today, what are your favorite type of cookies? I will be happy to knit a sweater for Jerome but I will not accept payment for it!""
B: ""I had been smoking since I was 20 years old but quit after the transplant. I feel so much better now. And thanks for your offer, but I insist on giving you money for the sweater.""
A: ""Tell you what, you can buy the wool for knitting it, but that's it! Deal? How do you feel about chocolate chunk cookies?""
B: ""Let's shake on that deal! I eat any cookies, so chocolate chunk would be just fine!""

A: ""What makes Kenyan food special do you think?""
B: ""It's just that local food is so different from what we are used to. There are grubs they gather from trees, for example, that when combined with the right spices and vegetables taste every bit as good as filet mignon.""
A: ""You know I've never had filet mignon. What is it?""
B: ""It's an overly priced cut of beef you can get in 4 star restaurants.  Personally, I prefer the simpler approach to food.  Food is so subjective.  I wish I could cook the way you can.  I'd be experimenting all the time!  ""
A: ""Yes, I've never actually cooked any African food, except cous cous, which is not exciting at all.""
B: ""It's all subjective, like I said.  I happen to love Injera flatbread, for example.  But, as you know I love to try anything new.  Have you ever tried making samosa yourself?""
A: ""I have not. Unless you count buying it in a supermarket then sticking it in an oven. Looks like a fiddly dish to make.""
B: ""They all look fiddly to me since I can't cook! lol But I'd probably eat anything you could make.  Even with the spicy vegetables you like. ""
A: ""You know you're still young! For someone who loves a lot of dishes, if you can get hold of a kitchen you can learn to cook. Just keep trying!""
B: ""I'm too busy traveling to spend time in a kitchen. And when I am home, it's just easier to go to a restaurant with so many good ones nearby. ""
A: ""I got asked on a date! I haven't been on a date since high school and I'm nervous. I think we're going to try going to an Ethiopian restaurant.""
B: ""That sounds like a great place to go. Just make sure to set the expectations that you have been before and don't care for some foods. I made the mistake of not mentioning disliking a type of food once and it didn't go well""
A: ""That's a great tip. thanks. I am nervous about the date though. ""
B: ""Don't be too nervous. Just go have fun. If it isn't going well, run to the bathroom, send me a text and I will call with an emergency to save you.""
A: ""Thanks! I think the date will go well. I just haven't dated in so long I don't know what to say or talk about. ""
B: ""Well, instead of talking about things, ask questions. Like what do you like to do? Then find something in common and you will know what to say.""
A: ""Thank you. I don't know what I'd do without your help. ""
B: ""You would go on this date and rock it. I am sure of it. It isn't hard to have a good time if you just expect to.""
A: ""You're right. I need to just pretend like I'm getting together with an old friend and try not to overthink this so much. ""
B: ""Exactly. And if you are not uncomfortable or awkward, the other person will have a great time too. Let me know how it goes!""
A: ""I will for sure. do you think I should plan something besides dinner? or is that enough for a first date on it's own?""
B: ""You could always set it up so that after dinner if you had fun, the two of you can walk down the street or something. Nothing too big. You don't want to be overwhelmed.""

B: ""Ah that sucks you have to work weekends. I'm so lucky, my boyfriend takes care of everyting I need so I hardly have to work at all. Being in the army sounds awful.""

B: ""Yeah I'm truly blessed and I know it. What does the sanitation department actually involve? It sounds... messy lol.""
A: ""It is very messy, it's basically just making sure EVERYTHING is sanitized. And I mean everything! So how's life in Hollywood? It must be prestigeous!""
B: ""Yeah it's crazy! I just saw Reese Witherspoon walking down my street yesterday, I so wanted to run up and fangirl haha. There probably aren't too many celebs in the army.""

B: ""Nice! There are heaps of budget watches I can recommend... will make a list and let you know! I just got back from work actually. Have you been busy since we last spoke? It's been crazy here.""
A: ""Thank you so much. Can you add the fact that I want something a bit sleeker when looking? ""
B: ""Definitely! But I wouldn't have thought that was like you. You seem so practical and down to earth in your attitude to material things.""
A: ""Again thank you, I haven't been to busy just avoiding bears. What has kept you busy?""
B: ""It's sale season! So many customers. If it keeps up I might join you in the tundra haha. You'll have to teach me some bear avoidance tips.""
A: ""Sure would! Safety is key. I figured you might be busy doing some shopping of your own. ""
B: ""I wish!! I figure it's all money in the bank so all this overtime just means a HUGE shopping spree for me at the end of it. How close is your nearest shop? I'd die if I was that far from a mall, lol.""
A: ""There isn't much shopping options here. But maybe if you moved here you could be one of them! Watches shipped from the Tundra would be a novelty. ""
B: ""Yeah bear themed watches maybe! Or you could make your own line of meditation watches. Does it get lonely?""
A: ""Hold off on that watch I was wanting a bear ate my snowshoes, luckily I wasn't wearing them at the time.""
B: ""A bear ate your snowshoes?""
A: ""I had opened the door to let the fresh air in, went to the toilet, and by the time I came back a bear had entered my home and was enjoying my best snowshoes as a chew toy. Luckily, I just made a lot of noise and the bear quickly retired. It was not an aggressive bear.""
B: ""Lucy the bear didn't eat you. That's a good thing.""
A: ""I do feel very blessed to enjoy this earth another day. It does serve as a reminder, though, of how precious time is. Do you feel like clocks make our short lives feel even shorter, or help live each moment with intention? Is that why you got into the watch business?""
B: ""They sure show you that time passes faster than we sometimes want. I found the design of watches to be mathematically incredible. But math is not my strong point. Heh.""
A: ""No? What would you say is your strong point?""
B: ""I really don't know. I only know that I have always had a problem with fractions. However, I do enjoy geometry.""
A: ""I understand. Geometry can be very enjoyable to study, especially for someone who enjoys seeing math represented in the physical world. I have two thoughts that may help with how you perceive and work with fractions. May I share them?""
B: ""By all means, do so.""
A: ""My first thought is that fractions are our friend. They enjoy keeping your work tidy. For instance, while a decimal might decide to repeat into infinity, a fraction is compact and stays put. 1/3 instead of .33333333333333, for instance. My second thought, and this is more of a question for you to consider, is would fractions seem more friendly if you always applied them to shapes? For instance, instead of 1/5, perhaps one star arm.""
B: ""One star arm. That's an interesting thought.""
A: ""What is the most expensive watch you've ever sold?""
B: ""it was a little over a million dollars. ""
A: ""Wow what brand was it? Was it perhaps a Rolex or Cartier?""
B: ""it was a Vacheron Constantin Tour de I'Ile""
A: ""Now that's quite a fancy name. Did you buy it through the watch dealer or on your own?""
B: ""Oh I didn't buy it. It was just one that I sold to someone at my work. ""
A: ""My mistake. You did say that. I would've come to your job to get a watch, but after the bear ate my snowshoes, I have to put my money towards new snowshoes instead. How is your shoe and clothing collection coming along?""
B: ""You never did explain exactly how the bear was able to eat your shoes. I haven't been adding to my shoe and clothing collection recently though. ""
A: ""Up here in Alaska there are many polar bears. After shoveling snow, I left them outside so I wouldn't track snow through the house. When I went back to get them, I saw a polar bear tearing the snowshoes to threads! I'll probably order some off of Amazon since my car's in the shop and I can't get to the mall that's 40 miles away.""
B: ""That's actually kind of scary that a bear would just come up to your house like that. I guess you can tell I'm from the city, huh?""
A: ""You do strike me as a city slicker. It's really tough living in Alaska, as it's very remote and everything's super expensive. Plus, it gets very lonely out here being away from my family.""

A: ""it's true that it is your body, but doing certain things while pregnant can cause complications for you and your baby. ""

B: ""Very well, now that the wife and kiddos are in bed.""
A: ""Do you have a big family?""
B: ""We have three kiddos, so there is never any ice cream in the house.""
A: ""You should start hiding it! I come a large family and I sometimes do the same.""
B: ""I tried hiding it in the peas, but my wife found it.""
A: ""Maybe you will need to sneak off to the ice cream shop alone sometimes.""
B: ""Its easily done on the way to clients houses, plumbers are always on the go.""
A: ""There aren't any ice cream shops near me, I live in a very small town.""
B: ""We go on the way to the parks too, in the next town.""
A: ""That sounds great! Do you live in a large city? That is my dream.""
B: ""I don't. I live in the country, with dogs, kids and chaos.""
A: ""I live on a big horse farm, I was born and raised here.""
B: ""That would be amazing. I love horses.""
A: ""They are amazing animals. Honestly, I prefer them over most people.""
B: ""I prefer animals over most people too.""
A: ""I just got back from riding one of my horses. ""
B: ""Well, that makes for a wonderful morning outing. I haven't ridden today. ""
A: ""It was very enjoyable! When was the last time you went horseback riding?""
B: ""About a week ago. I've been so busy with my plumping business. Seems like every tap around here is leaking. Do you ride often?""
A: ""Everyday. The horses on the farm need to get their exercise. Do your kids like riding as well?""
B: ""They do, but they're just learning to trot. Every time I take them, we go for ice cream afterwards. I'm not sure what they like more - the horses or the cones. ""
A: ""Ice cream sounds like a great treat. I might go get some myself. What flavors do you enjoy?""
B: ""I'm kind of boring. Usually a good quality vanilla is my fave. My kids like those space color ones that stain their faces. What about you?""
A: ""Salted Oreo. It sounds odd but it is amazing!""
B: ""Oh, I'd probably like that. Here in the country there a little shop that sells the best salted caramel. After a big plumping job, I treat myself. ""
A: ""The farm might need some plumbing work soon. Do you work on older buildings?""
B: ""Yes, all kinds of buildings. Not to brag, but I'm the best around here. Plus my prices are reasonable. Let me know if you'd like a quote. ""
A: ""Ben and Jerry's saw one of my Twitter comments about their Chubby Hubby ice cream, and they reached out to me to be part of their next ad campaign!! Crazy!! I'm so excited!""
B: ""Wow! That is so exciting! What do they want you to do for the ad?""
A: ""The want to come to the farm and do a set up for the commercial. I will be riding a horse and eating ice cream. My two favorite things!""
B: ""That is so cool! I assume you will be riding one of your own horses?""
A: ""Absolutely. If we need another person in the commercial, I will suggest you. You have a lot of experience in the saddle too. Are you interested?""
B: ""Sure, that sounds like fun! So will you be eating Chubby Hubby ice cream?""
A: ""You know it! I wouldn't have it any other way. You can eat Vanilla if you get to be in it too!""
B: ""Yes, that one is my favorite. I've never tried eating ice cream while riding a horse though. Have you?""
A: ""No. It may be messy! I guess I will find out.""
B: ""Yeah, I guess you will! And maybe me too! So what is the name of the horse you will ride?""
A: ""Trigger. I know it's not original, but it's easy to remember. ""
B: ""Nice! And what kind of horse is Trigger?""
A: ""Since you are coming to my farm, do you want to bring your horse or ride one of mine?""
B: ""If you don't mind, I will bring my own. I'm very excited, but not as excited as the kids!""
A: ""Okay sounds great! should I pick up some ice cream for everyone too?""
B: ""Please do. Just make sure you have some vanilla!!! How many horses do you have?""
A: ""I have 5 horses right now and I'm thinking of going to the auction to rescue some more since I have the room. ""
B: ""Sometimes the county you live in has horses they have rescued and give them to a good home for free!!!""
A: ""thanks. i'll look into that too. I just want to give a loving home to as many horses as possible.""
B: ""I know. They are a lot of work, but if you enjoy them.. They are the best things in the world. ""
A: ""I do enjoy it a lot. so anything else I should get for when you visit besides vanilla ice cream?""
B: ""No. You have already done enough. If we need anything else, I will bring it. Again, thanks for the invite.""
A: ""oh I don't mind getting some other snacks. I just want to make sure it's something your kids like.""

A: ""Ha, I love dogs, but my italian wife doesn't!""
B: ""No bees for me, it is a scary way to die. An allergic reaction.""
A: ""I understand, I'm glad I'm not allergic to papaya, I eat a lot of it!""

B: ""Have you convinced your wife to let you get a dog yet, or does she still really not like them? I don't know what I would do without my dogs. I've considered creating clothes for them...""
A: ""She hates dogs and I've tried so many times to change her mind but Ithink she had a bad experience when she was younger back in Italy. I understand I suppose but it does frustrate me a bit.  ""
B: ""Aw, I didn't know something bad happened to her. I can definitely understand that a bit more, but I hope she can heal from that and realize all dogs are different. On an unrelated note, I was curious to go out and try papaya after our chat since you love it so much... and wow! I love it!""
A: ""It is so good for you. I love it. People say healthy foods aren't good for you but try papaya, pineapple and mango in a bowl and it's like heaven. Full of vitamins too.""
B: ""I've always loved fruits, but for some reason I hadn't tried papaya. Healthy foods are the best! I do love baking and eating sweets, but I do my best to not overdo it. ""
A: ""It's so tempting to just eat bad foods, there is so much out there that it's hard to avoid it. I'm glad that you have finally tried it. It's not always easy to get hold of.""
B: ""Most ""bad"" foods are fine in moderation, so that's something to consider if you have a craving every once in a while. Life is too short to avoid sweets forever!""
A: ""I know but the older I get the more serious I'm taking my diet. I think the choices we make now stay with us for a long time.""
B: ""That's definitely a good way to look at it. As much as I want to enjoy my youth, I don't want to be unwell in my old age. I don't like thinking about getting older because it makes me think about how my dogs won't be around forever.""
A: ""I have a new papaya recipe that I discovered and want to share.""
B: ""Awesome. Is it a savory or sweet recipe?""
A: ""It is a sweet recipe, I've previously done savory recipes and I wanted to try something new. What are some of your favorite baked goods?""
B: ""I love apple crumbles. Though I had the best cream pie the other day. It was a salted caramel with chocolate crust.""
A: ""Oh that sounds delicious, I've had some pretty good apple crumbles before but never a salted caramel cream pie. What types of fruit do you think make the best pastries ?""
B: ""You know I'm not sure. Probably strawberry? I love salted caramel everything. Forget pumpkin spice as the fall flavor. ""
A: ""I do think strawberry makes some pretty tasty pastries. I've got to try salted caramel flavored pastries more. Yes, pumpkin spice is definitely overrated at this point. ""

A: ""I will have to try it and let you know. what's your favorite flavor of tart?""
B: ""I like them with cherry. But I always wondered if they could make them with blackberries or something. I have not tried a bunch of flavors. ""

B: ""Oh, that does sound interesting. I wonder if you could do one with bacon? They seem to be making everything with bacon now.""
A: ""I'm going to have to google that and find out. I'll try anything with bacon once!""
B: ""I like bacon wrapped jalapenos or mushrooms filled with cream cheese and Velveeta. Now if there could be a tart like that, I would eat them always.""
A: ""you should just try it and see how it goes. ""

B: ""Haha no not adults! I sing to my kindergarten class all the time though, if that counts. But I save my Taylor Swift performances for the shower.""
A: ""LOL. I like to sing in the shower too, mainly stuff I've heard in the radio really. You could try out for a talent show :)#""
B: ""I think I would be too shy! But that's the dream. Have you ever done anything like that?""
A: ""Not really. When I was younger I was part of a musical performance which was fun but I think standing in front of people on your own is a different story. I think I'd get stage fright!""

B: ""Nice! Yeah, you've got to do what you need to get by. That's so cool you're studying to be a vet! You must see a lot of wildlife in all your time outdoors.""
A: ""Yeah all the time when I'm hiking in nature. There is so much to see and a lot of it is on your doorstep!""
B: ""When you qualify as a vet you could even open some kind of nature sanctuary and help injured animals.""
A: ""I think that would definitely be more rewarding than working on people's pets. I'd much prefer to be a vet that visits farms, helps livestock or yes, helps wild animals. I've always dreamed of visiting Africa. That would be so cool.""
B: ""Wow awesome! What an adventure that would be. I'd love to visit Africa someday. My dream trip is visiting Nashville though, and seeing some of my favorite country singers sing in person. ""
A: ""How has the singing kindergarten teacher been? Have you arranged your dream trip to Nashville yet?""
B: ""I've been great.  No plans yet, but school is almost off.  I think I will sit down and plan out a visit in July.  Have you ever been to Nashville?""
A: ""I have been to Nashville, but didn't make it to the exciting  music/bar section. I've heard it's great. Who will you take with you?""
B: ""I am probably going to take my friend who is actually another teacher at my school.  She doesn't love Taylor Swift, but she is a big fan of country music.  I think she grew up near Nashville so she is sort of an expert I guess.""
A: ""You should see who is playing in Nashville in July and plan to see groups you both will like. Who knows perhaps Taylor would be there herself taking in the music scene. There are lots of other interesting things to do in Nashville as well, maybe take a guided tour of celebrity homes or something similar!""
B: ""Oohhh wouldn't that be exciting if she was there?!?  Thanks for the suggestion because they is a really good idea. What about you? Will your summer involve your African dream?""
A: ""Well, I'm still looking into it; no plans as of yet..but you never know! I'm trying to put together a travel plan so I see most everything that I would like while there. It would likely be a several week trip. I still have some classes to finish up at Vet school this summer.""
B: ""When these summer classes are done will you be a full blown vet?  Any thoughts in where you may work after you are finished with school?""
A: ""I looked up a few people going to nashville when you are there and prepared a program! ""
B: ""What kind of program is it? I wasn't planning on doing one, but I would love to be involved.""
A: ""it's kind of like a schedule of events going on around the city during the times you'll be there. I just made a list of dates and places so you can go do something if it interests you. ""

A: ""I haven't quite made up my mind on which one I want to do yet. maybe I can do both?""

B: ""I might just try that. I doubt I'd qualify for management, but maybe a different job. Or I can go back to school. How do you find the motivation to work out?""
A: ""My biggest motivator to start were my dogs. They always want to run and play, and I want them to be happy. I found the more I got out with them, the better I felt""
B: ""Oh wow, that makes perfect sense. I've always wanted a dog, but my parents don't like fur or mess. I'm responsible enough, and maybe I should foster a rescue. ""
A: ""Fostering is a great idea! So many animals need love. Maybe seeing you take responsible for another creature will help your parents stop picking at you.""
B: ""Yes, they nag at me a ton. And it makes me feel so awful, I end up eating Burger King after work. The weight gain is making me feel worse. A dog might help me make changes. ""
A: ""I'm sorry that you're feeling so awful.  Sounds like you definitely need a change of pace. I really enjoyed starting to exercise on a treadmill, do you have one available?""

A: ""That's great!  Getting started is always the hardest part.  What kind of exercises are you doing?""
B: ""I'm doing some cardio, but I'm focused on strength training. Do you have any suggestion or advice for me?""
A: ""Always try and mix both, you don't want to jump right into weight training without warming up with cardio first.  And I can't stress enough the importance of stretching before AND after working out.""
B: ""I need to stretch more. Do you think so Yoga would do me some good?""
A: ""I'm afraid I don't have much experience with yoga, but from what I've seen it can be a thorough full body stretch routine.  Do you listen to music at all when you work out?""
B: ""I do listen. I find that it helps me get engaged with what I'm doing. ""
A: ""It makes sense, I read somewhere that they did a study that proved music helps keep you focused and you end up working out longer.  I'm a fan of heavy metal when I work out, how about you?""
B: ""I like heavy metal, punk, grunge. They all get me going and help me maintain a good workout pace.""
A: ""Exactly, I love classic AC/DC, it's the perfect rhythm for running on the treadmill.  Have you started looking for a new job, by the way?""
B: ""I have. I have my resumes out at several places. Wish me luck.""

B: ""Yeah have you heard about the new yoga studio downtown? They do Hot yoga.""
A: ""I have never heard of Hot yoga. Is that like in a sauna?""
B: ""I think it’s close but not quite as hot as a sauna. They do turn the temperature up so you sweat and get squishy.""

A: ""I don't know, but I am not sure that you can listen to heavy metal while doing yoga. We have to check into that. ""
B: ""Oh! Don’t worry. I have an extensive musical playlist copied to my brain that can play metal for hours without needing the actual CD. ""
A: ""Ok cool. I hear they play like meditation music or just nature sounds for yoga, it was one reason I was advese to it.""

B: ""You are funny! Did you ever ride motorbike? I love it!""
A: ""No, I never have. I'd die if I did. I just know it.""
B: ""Well I do wear a helmet to keep from brain injury!""
A: ""That's good unless your head falls off. What then?""
B: ""Well, I'm hoping to keep my head!""
A: ""How did you get started riding motorbikes?""
B: ""My dad was an enthusiast! I guess I inherited it from him. He was such a rev head. It's funny how we pick up our parents hobbies.""
A: ""That is true. My parents were artists in their own right which is why I'm studying it. ""
B: ""That's awesome! They must be so proud of you. What kind of artists are they? Would I know any of their work?""
A: ""My mom was a photographer and my dad a painter. Part of why I go to Europe is to visit their gallery. Have you traveled to Spain?""
B: ""No I've never been outside the US sadly :( That sounds so wonderful. Hopefully one day. Is your family of Spanish descent?""
A: ""Yes, I have a very famous ancestor. You should make it a goal. I bet it would be fun to ride your motorcycle through out the Spanish Country side. ""
B: ""Oh of course, I forgot about your famous ancestor! Yes that sounds brilliant. What a dream. Do you do much traveling apart from Europe? ""
A: ""I try to travel as much as I can. Enjoy different types of art that you can only see when traveling. ""
B: ""Yes, not to mention all the exotic cuisine! I'm not very adventurous in that respect. Travelling more would definitely help!""
A: ""No es cargo for you then hey? There are plenty or rice options or kebab shops across europe. ""
B: ""Haha yes! What's the strangest thing you've ever eaten?""
A: ""I'm hoping I can present something in my parents gallery someday soon. That would be amazing to me!""
B: ""I'd love to come and visit Europe for the first time and see your art! What kind of art would you present? ""
A: ""That would be amazing. I'd probably present a portrait, those are my specialty. ""
B: ""Wow! Did your dad teach you to paint?""
A: ""Yes, my dad is a great teacher, he taught me some great techniques. So what type of restaurant do you work in ? ""
B: ""Definitely not as fancy as the restaurants in Europe where your parent's gallery is! Do you go visit their gallery often?""
A: ""Ah, yes the restuarants there are pretty upscale, fairly expensive. I can unfortunately only visit twice a year due to my college schedule""
B: ""Ah I definitely don't miss being in college! Is it hard being away from your parents for that long?""
A: ""Yes, college can be a struggle at times. Yes it is hard not being able to see my parents for that long, but it definitely makes it worth it when I do see them. So is it exciting riding a motorbike?""
B: ""It was very exciting the first few times!! Not so much anymore though. Was it exciting the first time you got to visit your parents gallery?""
A: ""It sounds a bit scary but at least you protect yourself with your helmet. Yes it was pretty exciting getting to see my parents accomplish something so grand. ""
B: ""I bet!! How long until you will be able to present one of your portraits there?? I can't wait to come see!""
A: ""I've been thinking of getting a motorbike.  I want your advice about a model that I could start with.""
B: ""Ok let me figure out which way your metaphorical motorbike in your head is leaning.""
A: ""I want it to be a real one. I am wanting to get something that can have a balanced and comfortable seat. I would like it to be able to keep up with traffic, but not change speeds so fast I flip randomly. I want to be able to have an easy time with balance, so it needs to have even weight distribution.""
B: ""Woah woah woah you just jumped out of the starting line with this metaphorical motorbike faster than I could ever keep up with you! How about I just ask you what color?""
A: ""I don't care about color. I want to learn to ride. I just thought that you would be a great place to start with finding the right brand or whatever since you know how to ride. I want to be safe and feel comfortable. Not look hot.""
B: ""The moment you feel safe and comfortable on a motorbike is the moment you are headed to the ER with multiple hurts in multiple places on your body. Always know you are a moment away from possible death and dismemberment ""
A: ""I guess I don't like the idea of a motorbike. I thought it would be a fun learning experience, but if someone like you cannot even help me out with where to start and are going all the way to that, maybe it is not such a good idea.""
B: ""It is not a good or bad idea. It is just a stone in the pond with lots of ripples to affect all other areas of your life. Not an easy choice like pancakes vs. waffles. ""
A: ""I think I will just stick to my pickup. It seems safer and less scary.""
B: ""Yeah it is much safer. Unless of course you have a Toyota pickup truck.""
A: ""How do you know what kind of pick up truck I have??? And, how would that be more scary than death and dismemberment?""
B: ""You never heard the conspiracy theory about Toyota, advanced nanobot drones and illegally cloned DNA from Gojira?""

B: ""yes, she is still in demand, really am proud of her. we train together, each to our own goal. Do you prefer to train with a group or alone?""
A: ""I usually train solo as my sport is marathon running so I'm always going at my own pace. It can get lonely sometimes. I'm jealous, it would be great to have a training partner.""
B: ""It keeps you honest, at least LOL. We usually celebrate with a papaya smoothie afterwards. How do you prepare your papaya?""

B: ""Yes. Lol. I will stick to the bees and she can still to web design and modeling.""
A: ""Even if you two have opposite feelings about bees, it's great that you can come together to work out. Hopefully my training partner is as supportive.""

B: ""Those things happen so quickly. Did it happen last week? I'm so sorry you're having to go through this... are you in a lot of pain?""
A: ""The day before yesterday. The pain isn't bad with all the meds they have me on. But I'm both depressed and really, really bored. I've never sat still for so long in my life!""
B: ""Yes I can imagine! How long did they say you'd have to wear the cast? I hope they've given you suitable crutches to help you get around (once a tall friend of mine was given some that weren't high enough for him!)""
A: ""They haven't said just yet. I may require surgery, but they are still discussing whether to put a pin in my leg. I've been here in traction for 2 days so they haven't even mentioned crutches yet. I hope no surgery, but I don't want permanent damage either.""
B: ""Ah man, I hope they decide quickly on the pin so at least you know what to expect. Permanent damage is definitely the worst outcome, but I'm sure the doctors will be able to sort you out even if the recovery is a bit slow. Being in traction for 2 days sounds rubbish! Have you watched any good movies to keep your mind occupied?""
A: ""Not at all. Actually that's why I was messaging you. Do you have anything lighthearted to recommend? I need something to get out my funk.""
B: ""Good question! I've watched a couple of movies recently but they were not necessarily lighthearted (The Great Escape and O Brother Where Art Thou). Have you seen either of them? The Netflix series ""Queer Eye"" is always a feel-good choice and the episodes are about an hour. ""

B: ""The dogs are sleeping right now. Pot farm is the bomb have you played it by any chance?""
A: ""No I haven't, I'll make sure to check it out. I usually play FromSoftware games.""
B: ""You should I give it a try, it's a funny game where you harvest... drum roll... cannabis LOL. What type of games you like from them?""
A: ""Hahaha sounds sophisticated. I love all their games to be honest, but my favorites are Sekiro and Bloodborne. Do you play other games? Is starcraft a game?""
B: ""Sekiro, eh? I like that name... it sounds japanese, right? I don't play many games actually but I've indeed played StarCraft""
A: ""Yeah Sekiro is Japanese, as are all the FromSoftware games. I don't play games all that much tbh. I mostly livestream philosophical discussions. ""
B: ""Gotcha, that's what I thought. Alright, you can't just say that and leave me like this... tell me more about that. Do you participate in philosophical discussions or are you mainly an spectator? ""
A: ""I participate in them quite often, I also organize debates on my twitch account. You watch twitch, maybe you've seen me on there. I'm quite big.""
B: ""That's amazing. I do watch Twitch, what's your handle? I might have actually seen you already and if not will make sure to fix that LOL""
A: ""@L0neWolf you should check it out. How's the dog walking business?""
B: ""Will definitely give it a try. I certainly enjoy entering into never-ending philosophical debates hahaha. I definitely enjoy it I see it as a nice way to do exercise, play and make some dogs happy and being paid for it!""
A: ""I think I may livestream Sekiro sometime soon instead of the usual debates. That way you could check the game out too if you want!""
B: ""Sekiro sounds awesome, what is your favorite part of the game?""
A: ""The combat design is excellent, and the addition of the grappling hook adds so much mobility over other souls-like games.""
B: ""I don't know a lot about the game, but all of those features definitely make me interested in checking them out. What are some other games in that genre that you enjoy?""
A: ""I'm sure I mentioned Bloodborne before, it's another great take.  Just to explain, souls-like means games like Dark Souls, which are typically all very challenging.  But if you can learn how the enemies work you can dominate and that's super rewarding.""
B: ""Thank you for explainging what souls-like means, I really had no idea, so it is cool to have a better understanding. Always fun to dominate in a game as well. Do you ever play sport games?""
A: ""I used to, but they're mostly made by EA and they've gotten a really bad reputation lately, so I'm way less interested.  How are your dogs behaving today, by the way?""
B: ""They have really gone down hill at EA with their games. My dogs are being great, they just went outside and are relaxing right now. What is your favorite type of dog?""
A: ""I like a mid-size dog, but with a calm temperament, which is a tricky balance.  Golden retrievers are too high maintenance for me, for example.  I'd love some recommendations?""
B: ""Well you might not like my recommendations because I love golden retrievers haha. But I also love german shepards and chocolate labs. My dream dog is a husky however.""
A: ""Huskies are gorgeous, but also super high energy.  I guess I'll have to keep looking.  Speaking of dogs, how is the walking business?""
B: ""It is amazing, I love meeting people and their dogs, and forming business relationships with them. It is such a rewarding experience!""
A: ""I beat that last boss in bloodborne""
B: ""Wow, that's awesome. I'd love to watch your stream on twitch sometime. When do you usually stream?""
A: ""I usually start around 9pm and go until I feel like going to bed, which can vary since I don't stream everyday.  Have you ever tried streaming your games on Twitch?""
B: ""No, I haven't. I don't play games enough for it to be worth, I don't think. Maybe I could stream some debates or discussions some time, that could be fun""
A: ""Yeah it's worth giving a try, I think it's super fun and engaging!  If you do decide to follow through with it, let me know and I can advertise your stream on my channel! What sort of topics do you think you'd focus on?""
B: ""I think I would try to focus on some philosophical or political issues and try to gather people's opinions. I would have to choose between modern or ancient issues, I guess. What types of topics do you usually cover?""
A: ""We mostly cover applications of historical philosophy into modern decision making.  We've gotten into some pretty cool arguments about how certain philosophical ideas seem to recycle throughout history.""
B: ""Wow, that's awesome! Do you cover current events much or are you strictly focused on the theoretical?""
A: ""We try to stay out of current events, or at least we try to avoid taking a side when we do cover them.  While there's definitely a lot of interest for political content, my stance has been that it's too risky to wade into those waters.  It sure is tempting to do it anyways sometimes though.""
B: ""I can definitely see how that would be true. Chat sections can get pretty feisty. What else have you done on Twitch lately?""
A: ""I streamed a little Bloodborne last night, but otherwise it's only been my regularly scheduled debates.  I guess I've watched some Star Craft too, there were a lot of good matches last week.  Did you happen to catch any of them?""

A: ""My dad was a veteran and so I feel a strong connection and urge to be helpful.  Would you be willing to do some pro bono work, perhaps just an hour a week at the shelter.  Your skills as a life coach would be really valuable.""

A: ""I bought some strawberries kiwis bananas and some pears. how about you have you ever been on a diet?""
B: ""I did start somewhat of a diet when I got pregnant.  I don't know if diet is really the right word for it, but I've been actively trying to eat healthier for my baby.  I agree it's been hard, especially when I have cravings for sweets.""

B: ""Is it hard to find lots of different raw foods? Like, what do you eat instead of cheese?""
A: ""I found it hard at first because it's so limiting, but I'm discovering there's such a huge variety of fruit and veg that after I while I stopped craving things like cheese. I eat nuts too - by crushing them in a food processor I can make something similar to cheese. ""
B: ""Oh, yeah. I've seen vegan cheese at the supermarket made of nuts. Do you eat strictly vegan, or do you eat raw meets, like that Japanese dish that is raw beef? Sashimi would seem like a good option, if you didn't hate all sea food.""
A: ""I've been eating strictly vegan ever since I started my raw diet - I really don't like the idea of eating raw meat. And as you know, I hate seafood! That reminds me, are you still having weird cravings for oysters?""
B: ""Not as much now. Mostly I'm craving fruits and vegetables! I assume I need the fiber.""
A: ""I guess so! How are you finding your pregnancy so far? You must be so excited to meet your little one!""
B: ""I can already picture what she will look like. Do your children eat the same diet as you?""
A: ""No they don't - my wife eats a regular diet and the children follow her example - I don't want to enforce a raw food diet on them at such a young age!""
B: ""True. They could develop ricketts! Is it possible for that to happen to you?""
A: ""I'm being very careful to make sure I get all the nutrients I need. I take a few supplements for certain things that are impossible to get from fruit and veg, but you'd be surprised at the variety of nutrients raw fruit and veg contain! As long as I'm careful, I won't get ricketts.""
B: ""It sounds like you've thought this through very carefully.""
A: ""I've just applied for a new job.""

B: ""They are fiercely loyal. When I was just a child, Trooper saved my life. They really love their people.""
A: ""I remember you telling me about that. That is the main reason I've been considering getting a dog. My parents are getting older and I think it would be a good idea to have one to protect the house. ""
B: ""I can understand that. A dog might be a great companion for them, especially if they spend a lot of time at home.""
A: ""What breed would you recommend getting?""
B: ""Great Dane's are wonderful because they're so lazy and calm, but they also need a LOT of food. Black labs are wonderful family pets and do great on a farm.""

A: ""That's a good thought, I've been hearing about a bunch of new housing developments and they always need more electricians.  You got any interesting engineering projects coming up?""
B: ""Nothing too crazy honestly. mostly as you mentioned housing developments and projects of that sort. what made you want to move on from the farm?""
A: ""It's not going well with my parents, dad's not able to take care of the farm the way he used to, and I've talked to my parents about moving into a retirement home.  I can't run the farm by myself, so I'm already planning to sell the farm once they agree to move.""
B: ""That is unfortunate, but I get how stressful that can be, have you thought about taking the farm over and maybe hiring people? Or is that something you are simply not passionate about?""
A: ""I've worked the farm my whole life while also fighting for every second I could to go to school and learn my trade.  Maybe I'm still rebelling after all these years, but I can't imagine myself still living on this farm when I'm my parents' age.  How about you?  You happy with the farm life?""
B: ""I absolutely love farm life, but with that being said, I have always wondered what it would be like to live outside of the farm, but for me I think I am a farm boy for life. Plus Trooper loves all the area.""
A: ""I guess that's it too, I never settled down, despite how often my mother tried to set me up.  I feel like I'll have a better chance of finding a wife in the city.  Sorry things got so heavy, I've been pretty introspective lately.""

B: ""Yeah we could work something out if it ends up needing any pricey parts.  Let's wait until I can take a look at it though, the fix might not require anything other than some of the stuff I've already got in my garage.""

A: ""I'll look into that. I have adopted both of my cats, but neither from a shelter. One was an unwanted kitten and the other's owner was 92 and couldn't care for him anymore. How did you come to be guardian of your cats? Tell me the story!""
B: ""I have always loved cats, I got my first cat when I was six. His name was Elmer Fudd.  I have always been partial to orange cats, but really just cats in general.  I know that black cats rarely get adopted because people are suspicious of them.  I always like to pick the ugly cat or the under dog because they have less chance of being adopted.""

Henry's owner was so scared to put him in a shelter (he was 9 at the time) because she thought nobody would adopt him. I'm so grateful he's mine now! He's awesome.  Like your cats, he loves watching birds -- we sit on our screen porch and do that. Do your cats go outside? Or watch from windows?""
B: ""My cats go in and out all day long, they are quite spoiled it seems like I am always getting up to let them in and out.  Luckily they don't catch birds only watch them.  I have moles in the yard and I wish they would catch those but they don't seem to be interests.  Do your cats like to ride in your new car?""
A: ""You have sweet, gentle kitties! Henry has caught two mice but otherwise my boys aren't hunters either. The car has been great, but it makes me miss my old car's gas mileage. I used to drive a Prius and I miss that car more than I like the volvo!""
B: ""Why did you trade in the Prius?""
A: ""The cats hate the car, unfortunately. I think it makes them nauseous. It's a bummber because I live 8 hours from family, and so traveling to see them is important and I wish the cats didn't hate it so much! Do yours enjoy the car? ""
B: ""Mine don't like the car either, the minute i put them in the kennel they scream.  I once had a cat that did like cars, but it ended up being a bad thing because he later got run over by a neighbors car because he wasn't afraid of cars.  ""
A: ""I have been thinking, and I have decided if I do get another cat, I may actually get a young pair of kittens. My two cats are older and would likely not be much into playing together like kittens do. What do you think?""
B: ""I think it's a great idea. As you know I'm a cat lover. Make sure to send me pics if you get some!""
A: ""Oh of course! Do you have any idea what type of cat I should look for?""
B: ""I don't know what breed, but the type i like is usually black with long hair. More hair to clean up, but what's wrong with that lol""
A: ""I hear ya, my two cats have had their fair share of shedding! How are your cats doing?""
B: ""They are good, but like yours.. they are getting older. It's sad to see them age, but they have been great friends to me. I may be getting some more in the near future.""
A: ""You are thinking of adopting more cats too?""
B: ""Yes. I will go to the shelter or look for abandon ones. Those are the best!""
A: ""I think that is a great idea! Good luck, and send me pics too when the time comes!""
B: ""You know I will! You know how cat people are. ""
A: ""Oh yes, I know very well. I can't believe we are cat people now.""

A: ""Oh my! Beautiful! How are they adjusting to a new home?""
B: ""Bouncing around, little furballs of energy! They're not really so sure about the other animals just yet, but adapting. I'll send a couple pics later today.""
A: ""Great! Please do! I'm still on the lookout to add to my family. Cats are such great pets. ""
B: ""They're not as dependent as dogs, which makes them a LOT easier to care for....""
A: ""You got that right! You can go on vacation and leave them a lone and the will be perfectly fine.""
B: ""My vet told me that as long as a cat has fresh food and water (and perhaps another cat or two to keep them occupied), they're good for weeks. ""

A: ""Yeah, it can be a bit sad. I see my kids about as much as the patients do. Its good that you take care of your parents! I wouldn't mind being in a nursing home though because there would be more people my age that I can relate to!""
B: ""yeah, I try my best to take care of them as they're getting older. It's a real team effort to make sure they're on top of their medications and everything. I'm glad you found work you enjoy, you deserve to be happy. You should really start dating more often, maybe find a special someone?""
A: ""I think I need to hop on the treadmill first. Then I can find my soulmate and die old on the country side. Then horse ride off into the sunset, youll have to teach me how to ride!""

A: ""I've been looking at properties in the city.  There are some real bargains downtown.""
B: ""Where have you been looking? ""
A: ""I checked on Zillow, and with a few of the realtors. I also just drove around and looked at different places.""
B: ""I have started looking too, my only concern about moving to the city is that I will have to sell my horses""
A: ""I think living in the country is better, but if you have to move, you can check out the town houses over on Main st. They have a really good price and seem to be nice. Maybe you could just set up a school schedule so you could commute instead of move?""
B: ""I don't think so, it is my dream to live in a city. Selling the horses would help me generate more money for childcare. How are your children these days?""
A: ""I haven't heard from any of them today.

B: ""Haha nice to meet you larry. What kind of food?""
A: ""I'm an american chef that also loves fishing.""
B: ""Oh that is cool. I only eat organic kinds of food""
A: ""That's great! I spend all my time out of the kitchen on the water.""
B: ""Haha awesome. I use the internet a lot. Especially twitter""
A: ""I've never been on twitter. I read comics though. Still life twitter.""

B: ""Maybe you should. I need a organic chicken salad so bad""
A: ""I had a few days off recently so decided to go on a fishing weekend, I managed to catch five trout!""
B: ""That's great! What a fun start to spring. I used to go fishing with my dad. I know you're a good cook -- do you like to cook the fish you catch?""
A: ""I always eat what I catch.  I made a great pecan crusted trout in the oven.  I found the recipe on the internet. What's your favorite recipe site?""
B: ""That sounds so delicious. I love seafood myself. I love Bon Appetit and Epicurious! Do you have a favorite?""
A: ""I think that All Recipes has the most simple recipes to follow.  I don't like when a recipe gets very involved.  ""
B: ""Me either. Or when they go on forever with their life story before giving the recipe! Takes away from time spent, yanno, actually eating or doing other things. Like being outside, or reading, or whatever. You have such a variety of hobbies -- indoors and outdoors both. What's your favorite hobby? Fishing? Comics?""
A: ""I think my favorite hobby would be fishing, I just love being outdoors.  What about you? Do you like to be outdoors?""
B: ""I do! I love hiking and camping, and I'm a runner. We live in a really outdoorsy area where I am, and the sunshine lasts til after 930 PM even in April, so there's plenty of outside-ing to do here. :-) While I don't fish, I do love being on the water. We are near Lake Michigan so we are almost always at the beach. I want to buy a boat! Do you have a boat?""
A: ""That sounds great.  I know there are a lot of lakes in  your area.  I have a small fishing boat and also a fishing kayak.  Boats can be a lot of trouble, you have to maintain them frequently, but it is nice to be able to get out on the water.  When you run are you training for a race, or just running for the fun of it?""
B: ""Yeah, they're a ton of work - that's what my wife keeps telling me whenever I tell her I want one. :-) I used to constantly train for races, but life got in the way for awhile and I stopped. I've sent about the last six months getting back into race-shape (I'm not all that fast but just trying to not get injured), and I think I'm about ready to start signing up for things! There's a half marathon in Detroit I have my eye on. My favorite race I've done though was at Asbury Park beach in Jersey -- the ocean was beautiful! Do you walk/run/hike or anything like that ?""
A: ""I like to run but  mostly just do it to get exercise and burn some of my dogs energy.  I have done a few 5k's to raise money for charities, but a marathon seems very daunting to me.""
B: ""Running with a pet is so fun! I used to run with one of my childhood dogs. 5K is a great and fun distance; I like 10Ks too. I don't know if I'd ever run a marathon -- I'm not fast enough to do those long training runs regularly! It's like 4 hours of running every Sunday to do a long run, haha. I prefer shorter stuff that I can do more consistently. I like training for a half marathon but only because it gives me a longterm goal. Most people I know who run marathons really do a number on their bodies training. Doesn't seem good to me. However, marathon runners get to be marathon eaters so that's a plus! You like to cook, right? Can you recommend any good sweet potato dishes for carb loading?""
A: ""I want to check-in and see how your half marathon training has been going. Have you been running every week? Have you increase the amount of time and length of your runs?""
B: ""I have been running every week, when I started training for this event, I started slow, and each week I go up about 2 miles. I may not have the best time when doing this half marathon, but I for sure am dedicated to finishing!""
A: ""I don't think anyone could win a half-marathon on their first try, but even finishing is a big accomplishment.  13 miles, that's seems like nothing in a car but on foot... ""
B: ""Yeah it is rough, I am at about 10 miles right now, so almost there, just need to keep pushing. After the race I am definitely going to reward myself with a day on the water.""
A: ""That's a great idea, as you can guess it's my favorite way to relax.  Have you ever tried paella?  I've never had it myself but I found a recipe last night and it looks really interesting.""
B: ""I could tell! Nothing bats a day on the water. And excuse my ignorance what is paella?""
A: ""From what I'm reading, it's a spanish rice and seafood dish, seems like a good way to use my latest catches, if I can figure out how this recipe is supposed to go.""
B: ""Oh my that does sound delicious, two of my favorite things mixed together. What are some of your latest catches anything good?""
A: ""Another good cooler-full of trout, and plenty of sunfish that I threw back.  I swear I caught the same one five times in a row.  How about you?  Any fishing lately?  Or are you saving that for after the half-marathon?""
B: ""I haven't been able to get out on the lake as much as I like. I will say I am super excited for a little bit of perch fishing this summer, my area has some amazing perch fishing.""
A: ""Ah nice, people keep telling me there are Perch in my area but they must not like the color of my boat, as I very rarely catch any.  Have you picked a marathon date?  I assume there must be a couple coming up this summer.""
B: ""Yes, I am shooting for early July, potentially July 4th weekend. I am excited and cannot wait to get to the race!""
A: ""How is your training going? I have plenty of carb loading recipes if you want them?""
B: ""Really good. I'm running 12 miles three days a week, and a 16 miler on Saturdays. I'll have aerobic capacity to spare when I get to the half-marathon.""
A: ""Wow! That's really impressive. I like to run, but rarely for longer than a few miles. Do you feel prepared for the marathon?""
B: ""I am right now. When I get to within a week or so of the race, I'll pull my mileage back a bit and let things relax. And, yes, some carb-loading recipes would be great!""
A: ""Cool, I can send some over. They are mostly pasta-based recipes, and I can link you to some great lists on All Recipes too with many different options. Do you have any dietary restrictions?""
B: ""None at all. I'm pretty much an omnivore.... the only thing I won't eat is catfood... not yet, at least!""
A: ""I'm the same way, Catfood can be a great source of carbs though. Do you catch much of your own food from fishing?""
B: ""Not lately. Because I've been so focused on running and work, I don't have a whole lot of time for anything else. I do get an hour of reading in every night...""
A: ""Oh, that's great! When I'm not busy in the kitchen, I sink a lot of time into my comics, and want to try reading more too. Anything in particular you'd recommend?""
B: ""Find an author you like to read, and then read everything you can find by her/him. I like Peter Matthiessen, John Updike, Philip Roth, Robert Stone, etc.""
A: ""You seem pretty well-versed. I haven't spent enough time really getting into books as an adult. Do you go with e-books, audiobooks, physical books, or something else?""
B: ""I'm nostalgic for the real deal, so I usually order physical media (books, discs, etc). ""

B: ""id like that, but theres a local indie band playing here next weekend at the pub, youll love this band, called circle jerks!!!""
A: ""What do you like most about indie musib?""
B: ""I like the small venues instead of being in large halls and stadiums. It is more personal""
A: ""Yea that makes sense, it's probably nice seeing the bands a bit more close up too. Have you booked to see any live music this year?""
B: ""So far, I just have the one this weekend at the pub called circle jerks. I kind of go with the flow and don't schedule unless I could miss out, and so far nothing like that is happening.""
A: ""That's fair enough you don't want to book too far ahead. It's good when local pubs also have live music. There's a Irish pub near me which always has some live irish music playing over the weekend! Where I live there are loads of pubs actually; are there many pubs in your area?""
B: ""Yes, there are quite a few. Good ol' country boy ones and Irish ones mostly.""
A: ""What drink do you tend to order at the pub? I tend to be a beer person, unless I'm out for dinner in which case I'd probably order red wine. ""
B: ""Typically I also like beer as well. I like trying new craft beers. I recently tried an apple pineapple cider that didn't even taste like alcohol. Those are my favorite types of drinks where I can't taste the alcohol at all, lol""
A: ""I like craft beers too. Haha, I've never tried an apple pineapple cider, though I've had a pear cider before which just tasted like sugar. They are far too easy to drink!""
B: ""That sounds like it would be tasty too. I also feel like the sweet drinks are too easy to drink. Classic pineapple and rum especially easily go down the hatch lol""
A: ""Agreed! Pineapple and rum is such a good combination. A pina colada cocktail is just like drinking a dessert! At Christmas I tend to bring out the Baileys too, which is probably one of the sweetest drinks I can think of.""
B: ""It really is, especially the frozen ones, haha. In my family, my mom never drank through the year, but she did at Christmas and it was Kahluha and milk or cream. Yummy goin to the tummy! Too much not so great for the tummy though, hehe.""
A: ""There is a pub right near my house and I went there for dinner to order my favorite dinner. Black olive pizza, yum!""

A: ""I go pretty often. It's my favorite place to listen to live Irish music.""

B: ""That is what I hear! Plus being able to try that Chicago pizza would be legendary""
A: ""Exactly. You and I definitely have a love for black olive pizza in common, and Chicago is famous for its pizza.""
B: ""A deep dish black olive pizza? I think that might be an absolute game changer!""

A: ""I have read a little bit, and the biggest tip I can give from the experience, is to start investing while you are young. What interrest you about investing?""
B: ""I want to be self-sufficient and my own boss. Too long have I had to answer to someone else and be dependent upon others for financial security. Were you able to invest when you were young and how did it turn out? I see you may be forced to retire soon so I hope you can do so comfortably. ""
A: ""I was able to invest when I was younger, I had an advisor who helped me with my investments and they did a great job setting me up to be comfortable in retirement. Being your own boss is truly an amazing feeling. Especially when you had to answer to others for so long.""
B: ""I was thinking of investing in land or real estate as they have the biggest upside and generally least risk. Although I see many people getting rich on stocks such as GME or Cryptocurrency. What is your stance on any of the aforementioned?""
A: ""real estate is always safe, especially if you are in a thriving area. So totally love that. cryptocurrency is pretty new at the moment, but it definitely has a huge upside, but also presents a lot of risk, but if that risk pays off, you could be set up very nicely for life.""
B: ""I share the sentiment. Another potential area that is starting to get tapped is collectibles, specifically trading cards. A box of pokemon cards sold for almost half a million and a single Magic the Gathering card sold for over that.""
A: ""That definitely is another area where you can strike it rich. Have you considered purchasing any of those cards and selling them?""
B: ""Yes, I've dabbled in it and enjoy having them in my possession as they are also unique art pieces and easy to store. I want to take calculated risks now because even if it doesn't work out I am still young and have time to recover should it go south.""
A: ""Absolutely that is why investing young is so crucial, it allows you the chance to take risk and even make mistakes until you find out what works for you,""

A: ""Is learning English enjoyable for you?""
B: ""I would not say it is enjoyable but it is interesting to learn the differences in my native language and English. There is also a lot of slang words in the English language so that is difficult to keep track of. Do you speak any other languages?""

B: ""Hmmm. I guess following the doctor's advice might not be a bad idea. Maybe you can get a second opinion if you're not sure about what they said. Did they say how soon you could expect to get back to wrestling?""
A: ""At least 6 weeks without any training. Then they can remove the cask and start physiotherapy. Maybe I could hike in a park, what do you think about it ?""
B: ""I would check with the doctor or any specialist they refer you to. Hiking in a park sounds harmless enough, but it may depend on the specific damage done to your arm, as well as body mechanics - and a host of other factors. The important thing is to stay positive.

B: ""Doing just fine. Just pulled some cookies out of the oven. Smells heavenly.""
A: ""Sounds good, I just returned from a hike so cookies would be great right now""
B: ""Oh man. I bet my dogs would love going hiking. Just not my thing though.""

A: ""I bet you will do great, I will stick to rock climbing""
B: ""I have always wanted to visit colorado. Is it as beautiful as it is on tv?""
A: ""I think so, the mountains are covered in snow, where are you located?""
B: ""I live in central virginia. Lived here all my life. It is beautiful. But normal for me.""
A: ""Is there a hobby you have besides baking?""
B: ""My wife, my dogs and my baking are the loves of my life.""
A: ""Trooper and I went on a hike and the most interesting thing happened!""
B: ""oh that sounds interesting what happened?""
A: ""I saw three baby owls! they were beautiful! ""
B: ""that is pretty cool i have never seen an owl what colour was they""
A: ""light brown. so cute! speaking of cute -- tell me about your dogs!""
B: ""they are so energetic were always going on long walks but never really see much wildlife such as owls do you have any other hobbies""
A: ""nothing like a nice dog walk :-) I'm out in colorado so I hike a lot and rock climb. anything to be outside. do you hike?""
B: ""oh yeah i bet the weater is amazing for hikes and no not really like i said i enjoy biking so im rather on the large side haha""
A: ""biking is fun too! one way to burn off that baking :-) what's your favorite thing to bake?""
B: ""I do enjoy niking on nice days and i love baking different cakes like red velvet and carrot cake""
A: ""oooh I love red velvet cake with cream cheese icing! do you bake from recipes or do you just sort of know what to do?""
B: ""a bit of both really the more and more i bake a certain thing i start to remember and when im confiedent i will start experimenting have you ever baked?""
A: ""How was the weather today? Did you go biking?""
B: ""Not today sadly, had to take Major to the vet.""
A: ""Oh. sorry about that. Could it be that Major is tired of the long walks?""
B: ""Oh no, the vet actually said it's good that he has been walking so much, it's just a simple virus that should go away in a few days.""
A: ""I hope it goes away soon. How is King by the way? I suggest you take him to the vet too. you know viruses""
B: ""The doctor already gave me some medicine and told me to keep them separate, if King starts showing symptoms they said I'd be fine to just give him the same meds Major is taking.""
A: ""That's great. I'm thinking you are home watching over Major. You must have done some baking.. hmmmn yummy.""
B: ""I haven't started yet today, got home from the vet an hour or so but I'm planning on changing things up today and making a bundt cake.""
A: ""You know I could die for cakes. Blow me away by adding cookies.. I'll pick them up when I'm coming home from work""
B: ""Sure, I know a pretty good chocolate chip recipe but I think oatmeal raisin is my specialty.""
A: ""I don't mind trying new stuffs. Who knows, I could get them to replace my favorite""
B: ""I wouldn't be surprised if my oatmeal raisin took place as your favorite, it's definitely mine.""
A: ""I mentioned your baking to one of my coworkers. ""
B: ""Oh, really what did they have to say? If they want to see how good I am I'm going to be on that new show Best Baker.""
A: ""I was just about to ask you about reality baking shows! Is Best Baker your favorite? They said to find out where you work, if you're interested in their business.""
B: ""My wife and I own our own business. It is called Baking A Dream. Best Baker is a new show coming out so can't really say it is my favorite, but it will be fun to be on it and get my business name out there.""
A: ""Absolutely. That's a great name. Congratulations on getting on the show! When does it start airing?""
B: ""We go start filming next week. And I believe they said it would start airing a month after we finish the last episode. There are 12 of us competing.  ""
A: ""Oh wow. Best of luck to you. Will your wife be on the show, too?""
B: ""No, she has to stay home and take care the dogs. Since Major has that virus we don't want to leave him with anyone else.""
A: ""That's understandable. When you're on the set for the show, just focus on your baking and nothing else that's going on in your life. Will Major be cured, or will the dog have to deal with the virus forever?""
B: ""He should be fine according to the vet, but we have to see if the medicines work. I am a little stressed leaving her alone to deal with this, but she is telling me she will be fine.""
A: ""That's good. Did the vet say how long it would take Major to recover?""
B: ""No, we just have to see if the medicine work. I think if it doesn't they have 1 other one that they can try. ""

B: ""That's a solid plan. Perhaps you could ask for some tips or maybe even see if they'll let you play a song or two?""
A: ""I definitely ask for a lot of tips. I never thought about asking them if i could play though. That would really be a dream come true.""
B: ""Never hurts to ask. And the experience of playing in front of an audience could be valuable.""

B: ""Good! I'm glad I was able to help. That's what makes me enjoy my job so much. ""
A: ""I can definitely understand that. Did you have this kind of a passion before you needed chemotherapy, or did it only happen after that?""
B: ""After. While going through all of that I got to see lots of good people doing everything they could to help others. It inspired me to want to help others as well.""
A: ""That is really inspiring to hear. I know it is an awful thing that you had to go through. However, sometimes life because that much more meaningful after such a horrible event.""
B: ""Definitely. Few things can open your eyes to new things and perspectives reminders of the fragility of life. Each new day is another joy to experience after thinking, for a time, that you wouldn't have many more.""
A: ""I got a gig playing at the piano bar!""
B: ""That's so great, are they paying you well?""
A: ""Not really that great to be honest. I took the gig because I wanted to get some exposure. Maybe it'll lead to some better gigs in the future.""
B: ""Still glad to hear it, any exposure can't help and I guess it's sort of like you're building a resume. I just took on two new clients myself so I'm feeling pretty great.""
A: ""Wow, that sounds great. What kind of clients are they?""
B: ""They both came to me for life coaching, I basically just help them advance in their relationships, career, and life in general.""
A: ""That sounds like an interesting job. I was kind of shocked at first when you told me what you did for a living. How much do people pay for that kind of coaching?""
B: ""It depends on the client, how much time we spend and some other factors but it's usually around 200 dollars a month.""
A: ""Hmm, doesn't sound like a lot. You must have to have a lot of clients to make a living at it. How many do you have?""
B: ""At the moment I have 7 clients I see regularly, but that number can go up or down throughout the year.""
A: ""Do you have them come visit you at home, or do you just do it online?""
B: ""We meet in person sometimes, but a lot of my work is done over the phone or through video calls.""
A: ""My gig at the bar went so well - they want me to come back and play twice a week!""

A: ""what would be a good metal group to listen to ?""
B: ""Listen to old school Metallica. That's a good band to cut your teeth on. Metal isn't for everyone, but it has a cult following.""
A: ""Some say that the structure of metal is like classical music, is it true ?""

A: ""What was the hardest part of starting a Twitch channel? I'm worried about getting enough followers. How did you get enough followers to start earning a profit?""
B: ""The hardest part is trusting the process. I started promoting my channel on other social media platforms and doing collabs with bigger channels. What type of content would you have on your twitch?""
A: ""I don't know. I haven't found my niche yet. I'm not really good at anything.""
B: ""I am sure there's something you're good at. don't get me wrong, I am grateful for my platform but sometimes I miss leading a normal life without the fame.""

A: ""that must be so rewarding though, to work with animals and land like that. which part of it is your favorite?""
B: ""the animals, nothing beats seeing a fowl being born and watching it grow up. I imagine it is like having kids.""

B: ""None yet. I seem to be collecting them as I can not bare to part with them. Have you ever rode a horse before?""
A: ""I have never been on a horse before! What is the best thing about horse riding?""
B: ""You should definitely have a go, it is really exciting. I enjoy the fact you need to have a really close bond with the horse in order to get it to do what you want.""
A: ""But as a beginner I'd never have a close bond. It is quite a dangerous activity isn't it?""
B: ""Actually, the bond mostly comes from the horse. If you have a good horse you can give them your full trust. It is only dangerous if you do something silly that upsets the horse.  ""
A: ""Yeah I guess I should really try it out. I actually like taking care of animals too, if you can count my dog.""
B: ""That is how I got into horses. I always had an interest in them and grew up around them on a farm. It is like working a second job but its worth it. Maybe you could share a horse with another person to get started?""
A: ""I'd have to get lessons I think, there are a few stables around me, but I haven't looked into even trying to ride.""
B: ""Most stables will allow a free trial ride so that you can see if it is something you are interested in. If you got a horse where would you keep it?""
A: ""The horse would have to live in professionally run stables, I just don't have any space or experience at all with horses. My wife loves horse racing but more from a gambling perspective.""
B: ""That is probably a good idea. Some stables will look after your horse as well. This then allows you to just focus on riding. Does you wife ever win at the horse races?""
A: ""I looked into riding horses and there is a stable nearby.  I'm thinking of taking a ride this weekend.""
B: ""That sounds like a great idea! Is your wife going with you?!""
A: ""Yes! She is really excited to go, she has more experience with horses than I do, so she'll be helping me out quite a bit. Have you been riding lately?""
B: ""That's exciting! I have been so busy with work that I haven't been able to ride much outside of the farm. Are you going to stay at the stable? Or go on a trail ride?""
A: ""We'll probably be around the stable most of the time, so I can get used to it. If we have time, I'd love to do a short ride. Do you have any pointers for me?""
B: ""Just stay strong and confident! The horse can tell if you are nervous. I am sure your wife and instructor will help you out a lot. It's always best to start on a calm, even tempered horse.""
A: ""Thank you! I will definitely keep that in mind. Have you sold any of your horses lately?""
B: ""Oh yes. I think about 5 mares last week! Business has been steady. ""
A: ""That is great! Are they mostly sold locally, or do they get sold to customers from far away?""
B: ""As of late, the local scene has been popping off! Every now and then I will receive a call from an out of state client. I prefer to keep the horses close. Cheaper on travel costs!""
A: ""?I bet! How is the farm doing overall? Are you keeping busy?""

"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""Hi, how are you? Sitting here with my beautiful shepherd.""
B: ""Hey! German shepherd? I'm feeling pretty crappy right now.""
A: ""Yes! When I'm down, I pick up my coloring book. I love them!""
B: ""My wife spends so much money on those coloring books""
A: ""My husband had a hard early life, then adopted, so he lets me get whatever!""
B: ""How long have you been married? My wife and I are separating soon.""
A: ""So sorry. 5 years. And we live in the boondocks.""
B: ""I wish I lived in the boondocks but I've to stay close to my crappy job.""
A: ""Yeah, well, we are farmers. Sometimes it is a hard life.""
B: ""That sounds better than what I do selling cars.""
A: ""Oh, yeah, I'd not like that. We have sheep, horses and german shepherds.""
B: ""Do you have kids too?""
A: ""Two kids. And they like to color, too!""
B: ""We have 2 kids too and they like to spend all my money""
A: ""Kids are good at that! What about pets?""
B: ""We have a parrot who can be quite obnoxious.""
A: ""I rode one of my horses for the first time!  He seemed a bit hesitant to let me ride him, but eventually he warmed up to it and walked around my property without misbehaving.  It was a nice bonding experience for us.""
B: ""It sounds fun, I am sort of scared of horses.""
A: ""They're really sweet when you get to know them. Do you ever watch the Kentucky Derby horse race? It is held once a year and it is today!""
B: ""I'll watch it when I come across it on TV. But I did not realized it was on today. I'll try to watch it if I feel well enough.""
A: ""I'm so sorry you're under the weather. Do you know what's making you sick?""
B: ""It is not that I am sick, it is my family life getting me down""
A: ""You must be feeling stressed about the divorce. Do you wanna talk about it?""
B: ""nothing much I could say, we just decide it was best to get a divorce.""
A: ""I got divorced in my late 20s -- it was hard, but it led to me finding my wife whom I'm married to now! I know it probably feels like there's no end in sight, but you'll come out on the other side of it. Tell me something you feel hopeful or positive about? Might help you feel better""
B: ""The only thing positive is my job as a car salesman. I like meeting different people and making them happy with a new car.""
A: ""nothing like a good vehicle! I use my truck for everything. it feels like a family member! what type of cars do you sell?""
B: ""We are a Chevrolet dealership. You need a new truck?""
A: ""I like to ride horse everyday which makes the relationship between us good.""
B: ""I am scared of riding horses, but watching the races is always fun to me. what color horses do you have?""
A: ""I only recently started riding the horse but they are fun to feed and pet. I have 3 of them one black, one brown, and one that is a little different it has a purple stripe. I can only fit one horse in the Truck at a time though. Are there any Chevrolet that are big enough for horses?""
B: ""Haha, I don't think we have a vehicle quite that big, we could get you a chevy with a purple stripe to match your horse. A perfect match!""
A: ""If I could fit the horse in the chevy then I would be ready to be on a road show. I wouldn't be able to leave my other animals so its good that they won't fit. I really love my Truck. How is your parrot?""
B: ""My parrot is good, very chatty at the moment. When your husband lets you have anything you desire does that mean you can get as many horses as you want?""
A: ""I may have gone a little overboard on getting a horse with a purple stripe. My husband is very patient he didn't say anything but I can tell he is not very pleased. I think I will stick to buying coloring books for a little while. What is your parrot's favorite thing to say?""
B: ""my parrots favorite thing to say is definitely ""polly wants a cracker"" cliche isnt it? And haha, well I am glad he is patient, get all the coloring books and whatever else you would like as well!""
A: ""Did you name your parrot Polly because if you did and gave it crackers that would be funny. Yes my husband is a good man but I have to keep him happy to. He understands happy wife is happy life though can your parrot say that?""
B: ""I definitely named my parrot polly! And that is a smart philosphy to have! My parrot cannot say that but I must teach my parrot that!""
A: ""Does your parrot like crackers so she really wants a cracker when she says that? That is so good. Yes life is a lot better when we keep everyone happy. Are things any better with your family?""
B: ""It is a struggle right now, not great with my family. But I do appreciate you for asking!""
A: ""My kids asked my husband and I if they could have another dog. I am torn if we should or could add another German Shepard to the family. ""
B: ""Go with your gut. Have you ever had any other type of dog?""
A: ""We have, but German Shepards are the best for farm life.  And the kids love them. I think we might go look at some puppys later this week.""
B: ""Okay. Sounds like you've got your mind made up. What makes German Shepherds especially suitable for life on a farm?""
A: ""They are very good working dogs. Ours are trained to help us herd the sheep. We already have 2 females so if we do it another one I would want to go with a male. Then we can bred them later on.""
B: ""Okay, sounds reasonable. When did you start owning German Shepherds as pets?""
A: ""I have had them all my life. My parents owed a farm also when I was little those dogs are so loyal. They saved my son from a snake the other day.""
B: ""Wow. Sounds a lot more useful than my parrot. How is your son doing now?""
A: ""He is fine. Snake never touched him. We heard Lady growl  and next thing we know she had a dead snake in her month. We were afraid it might have bite her as she got a little sick after worse, but the vet said she is fine.""
B: ""That's good to hear. Hopefully he'll help out with chores around the farm, if he's able.""
A: ""He is a little young to be helping on the farm yet. He is only 2, but he does help me out. He likes to help get the eggs from the chickens.""
B: ""Aww. What a good boy. Well, maybe the other son, then?""

B: ""I will watch it later tonight then! I found a few homes I really like but they are so expensive! I have to save a lot more money than I thought, but I will hopefully have enough next year.""
A: ""Do you have any plans to go to the concert at the beach?""
B: ""I really want to, but I don't think I can make it this time. How about you?""
A: ""Nope. Some old friends from Germany are coming to visit. Do you have any vegetarian recipe recommendations that will impress them?""
B: ""That sounds like fun. I'm sure they'll love being so close to the beach. My favorite vegetarian recipe is basil pesto. I can send it to you, if you want. It's really easy. ""
A: ""that sounds great, thank you. did your parents teach you the recipe?""
B: ""No, it's a recipe that I found in an Italian cookbook. My kids really love it. The sauce keeps in the refrigerator for up to a week. So, I've got an easy dinner for a few nights, which is handy with kids!""
A: ""ah i see. you and the kids should come down to the beach to visit me!""
B: ""That would be wonderful. I'm sure they would love it. And I would love the easy parking. It's just so hard to find parking these days. And it's expensive to boot!""
A: ""they would for sure. do you know what beach you'd like to move close to in the future?""
B: ""I don't really know. Do you have any suggestions? I need to make sure the school district is a good one. Either that or wait until the kids are off to college. But then there's paying for college to worry about. Sheesh!""

B: ""Well I can understand that. If I have nothing to do all day, I would just keep painting until I realize what time it is.""

B: ""I love to help people find their passion, so I think I want to stick with being a teacher as the next step. But I wouldn't mind selling art on the side while teaching. Do you feel as though your boredom eating could be counteracted with another hobby?""
A: ""That's really wonderful. And yeah, you can always do both! I'm thinking I might just have to take up painting more seriously to give me something to do. I can only exercise so often without wearing myself out. I might have to be practice for your teaching career, haha. Do you feel like college is helping you hone it?""
B: ""I do! My professors are fantastic, and they go the extra mile to help make sure we learn new techniques to develop new skills. I can always help you if you would like!  ""

A: ""Definitely Starry Starry Night, it is simply so iconic. would love to get a replica to hang in my home.""
B: ""You could always try painting your own imitation! It's good practice no matter what, and if it turns out well you can hang it up too""
A: ""Haha very true, as you said, it may not turn out the best. But practice is what makes perfect! Thank you for being so inspiring!""

B: ""My favorite to cook is roasted vegetables. I know it sounds basic, but there's a trick to getting them all to roast evenly when they cook at different rates, and using fresh veggies from the garden just makes them out of this world. If you season properly, even vegetables can taste decadent!""
A: ""I agree, fresh food does taste a lot better. it is nice that you grow your own veggies.""

Have you learned about any good resources in your class?""
B: ""I know what you mean. I have written a few of my own comics but I would be very embarrassed to share. I have only been to one class so far but they told the most important thing is write on paper first. Apparently this helps with your creativity. ""
A: ""Yeah that's good advice.  I always write on paper and do find it helps.  I actually like immersing myself in a new environment when I write.  The only thing I've ever written that I still like was a short story I wrote while I was out fishing on the lake.""
B: ""That is really important actually. Finding somewhere you can immerse yourself into your writing ideal. I have a place I found near the river. It is very hard to get to but means I am the only one there. I sit there for hours watching the world and writing.""
A: ""Nice! That sounds super peaceful and right up my alley.  So, how has the cooking gig been going for you lately?""
B: ""Not as well as it used to. I thought being a chef was all I wanted in life but things have been getting very stressful lately. That is why I turned to writing to try and find a way out.""
A: ""I totally feel you there, I would never want to be a chef.  It seems so exhausting for the tiny amount of appreciation you receive in return.  Have you tried selling any of your comics that you've wrote yet? Or are you still trying to iron out your style?""
B: ""They definitely need some extra work but I think I have the right sort of story. I may even rival Spiderman in the future!""
A: ""That would be so cool if you could break through like that!  I feel like this generation has too much exposure to the old time superheroes and needs to come up with its own Spiderman.""
B: ""Exactly, that is where my comics come in and change the genre. It is just a shame I am not a good drawer as I have some really good ideas for how I want my characters to look.""
A: ""I'm having massive writers block today can you help?""
B: ""Well, I just started in my class, and we haven't gotten to tips for that yet, but when I have writer's block, I usually go for a swim in the river or do something physically active to let my brain thought process rest for a bit. I'm sorry to hear you're having a hard time writing today. That's the worst.""
A: ""Great idea! I will go for a swim this afternoon and hope that gets my brain tunring!""
B: ""Yeah, I know you usually go fishing, but that might be a little too quiet and docile to help with writer's block. I've found getting my mind off of it is actually what helps me through it. Although comics may not bring about as much block as poetry does.""
A: ""Great points. I might go for a bike ride too. Attack is from two sports :)""
B: ""Great idea. Sometimes the more I try to force an idea, the further away from me it goes. Cooking helps me too, but I know you're not really into that. Something about measuring things out and working to get a dish right subconsciously helps me work out my story lines too.""
A: ""Speaking of cooking...I am hungry! What is for dinner tonight?""
B: ""I thought I might make a pizza from scratch. Pizza dough is easy to make taste super delicious with little effort, and then of course toppings can change depending on my mood. What are your favorite pizza toppings?""
A: ""Yum! That sounds so good! You have to make that for me next time I am over. I love mushrooms, pepperoni and extra cheese, of course!""
B: ""I know it's highly controversial, but I love pineapple on pizza. I think I will do pineapple and pepperoni. The sauce, cheese, pepperoni, and bread all have that salty savory flavor profile -- the sweetness of the pineapple just adds a lovely juxtaposition. You can see I am passionate about food. If I'm with someone who just staunchly opposes pineapple on pizza, green bell pepper can have a similar sweetness effect.""
A: ""I am a huge pineapple on pizza lover too! We are a rare breed. Most people hate it. They are missing out, big time!""
B: ""Agreed! Our friendship has passed to the next level :) I once made a sushi pizza. I baked the crust with a bit of ginger, and then added the other sushi ingredients after it had cooled with some dabs of wasabi here and there. It was a boredom experiment and I wouldn't want it all the time, but it was delicious. I like thinking outside of the box with food and combining food from different cultures. I'd love to have a fusion restaurant one day ""

A: ""Hello, how are you doing today""
B: ""I'm great and just resting before I start my second job as a stunt double.""
A: ""I just came in from working on clearing the field in my tractor""
B: ""What do you have planned for dinner? Kosher is the only way I eat.""
A: ""Eating out, have to pick my sister up after she gets off work dancing at the club""
B: ""Is she a single parent? That is the type of household I was raised in.""
A: ""She is working thru school, she we play in the orchestra at church also""
B: ""That's good. Do you read books? I read about twenty in a year.""
A: ""That is great. I'm more of a classical music buff. Mozart and bach""
B: ""Are you very active? I try not to be since I've never broken bones.""
A: ""Working on a farm, I've to stay active. I work out regularly.""
B: ""Awesome. I only do walking and light free weights.""
A: ""I have a bench in my shed. Beyond that, it is all hard work and labor""
B: ""That's convenient and a great way to keep yourself healthy.""
A: ""I read a really good book last week. I wanted to know if you had read it.""
B: ""Sure, you know how much I love reading. What was the name of the book?""
A: ""The book is called Children of the Corn. As a farmer the title really stood out to me, but it's actually a really scary book.""
B: ""Yes, it is a scary book. I have read it and, actually, enjoyed it. Not sure I would have read it though if I was a farmer like you. Haha. How is the farm these days?""
A: ""Glad you enjoyed the book. The farm is doing well, thanks for asking. I have been selling some of my produce at the local farmers' market. Sales are better than I expected.""
B: ""That is great! I would love to visit the farmers market but I only eat Kosher foods. Maybe we can meet up one day and you can show me how the tractor works. I have a movie coming up and the actor whose stunt double I am will be playing a farmer.""
A: ""Showing you the tractor would be fun, especially with this new movie. I'd like to hear more about it, how is your work as a stunt double going lately?""
B: ""It is good. Quite a bit tiring at time. I really enjoy what I do even though I am not typically an active person. I try to get in the groove by listening to music but haven't found the right type yet. Any suggestions?""
A: ""That's a tough one. Since I mostly listen to classical music, I don't get into a lot of upbeat or popular music. When I do yoga I listen to Chopan or Mozart. It really gets my blood pumping. Yoga is good cardio. Maybe try that?""
B: ""I definitely try that. I hear classical can be really motivating if you pick the right artist. My mom was a single parent and used to play mozart on long car rides to pass the time. How is your sister doing?. ""
A: ""Guess you have your next song picked out then. My sister isn't doing well. She is in the hospital from a bad car wreck. ""
B: ""I am so sorry to hear that. I hope she will be ok. I am sure the people at your church will pray for her. I am here if you need anything from me..""
A: ""How long have you been a actor?""
B: ""I am not an actor. I'm a stunt double. I replace the actor when a dangerous physical activity must be filmed.""
A: ""I work on a farm. I am thinking of getting a cat.""
B: ""Pets are pleasant to have around. ""
A: ""What famous actors have you replaced for that you think I'd know?""
B: ""Tom Cruise. I jumped out of the airplane in Mission Impossible. Do you enjoy action movies?""
A: ""Oh wow. That was you?! That's awesome. I love action movies. Mission Impossible is one of favorites. Did you watch any movie recently?""
B: ""I like the Marvel super hero movies. Do you like Spider Man?""
A: ""Yes. I watch Marvel too. I probably watched Endgame for like 5 times.""
B: ""Yes, I enjoyed Endgame, as well. But I only got to see it once.""
A: ""Did you watch it in the cinema?""
B: ""Yes. I love going to the movie theater. I love the smell of popcorn.""
A: ""I've been looking at cats in shelters, they are all so cute, I wish I could rescue them all.""
B: ""I know what you mean. They should give a volume discount if you take a dozen home with you.""
A: ""That would be a dream, they'd be helpful for chasing the rats off the farm too.""
B: ""Would you let the cats in the house or would they be strictly barn cats?""
A: ""they'd be barn cats! have you watched any good movies lately?""
B: ""I've been rewatching some old Pixar movies, like Toy Story and Ratatouille.""
A: ""Ratatouille is a good film but I think superman will always be my favorite""
B: ""Do you prefer the old or new Superman movies?""
A: ""probably the older ones, I haven't had much time to watch films these days because i have been busy selling produce from my farm""
B: ""I like the light heartedness of the old ones as well. What types of produce do you sell?""

A: ""Today, he has been feeling better. The doctor put his foot in a cast and told us it will take 6 weeks to recover. I am feeling stressed, but less stressed than yesterday in the ER! ""
B: ""Oh wow, 6 weeks is a long time! Is he able to get around on crutches or is that even too difficult for him?""

A: ""Haha that is fair to stick to your favorite. Do you have a favorite local place to get it from?""
B: ""I don't. I generally just get the pre packaged brands that you can get in grocery stores. Do you get your ice cream from a local shop?""

A: ""Working from home sounds like fun. You'll get to see your family more and even set your own hours. I imagine it requires a good deal of self discipline, but I'm sure you have that in spades.""

A: ""I used to have a husky. I no longer do. He wasn't that crazy, though. Only got that way when we played. Freshmen are crazy and rebellious. I remember being in ninth grade. Times were simpler then""
B: ""I think that's why I like gardening so much.  The smell of them is like aromatherapy!  I have the roses, but I want more flowers that have a strong smell.  Any suggestions?""
A: ""Lily has a very strong fragrance. Are you having the kids read Of Mice and Men written by John Steinbeck? I can't remember if it was freshmen or sophomore year I had to. I really enjoyed the experience, though. We watched the movie, too, I believe. ""
B: ""We used to, but I hated when he would accidentally kill the rabbits in the book.  It's hard reading that over and over.  So, the programs you donate to?  Do they help with education/school, or fund something else?""
A: ""They do help. Some are just to give the children what they need. Like extra coats and shoes in the winter. Some give the school extra money for new textbooks and stuff like that. Each one funds something different, but they all help. That's why I love donating. The children are the future. Might as well supply them with what they need, you know?""
B: ""I wish more people realized that!  A lot of people say they don't enough money to donate, but even if it's $1, if everyone did that it would add up.  I mean, I don't make that much either, but a few bucks won't kill me""
A: ""That's true. Giving up a $1 cheeseburger for a day won't kill anyone. Besides, it could be your own children helping. Literally, anything counts. Our time on this earth is limited. We might as well make it to where the next generations doesn't have so much to worry about while they're so young. I do understand that some people can't afford it, but if they can go to McDonald's everyday they can.""
B: ""I feel the same way about people who don't take care of their pets.  My neighbor's cat is on her fourth litter and she won't get her spade because she ""doesn't have the money.""  Of course, she has some Starbuck's trenta frappachino soy extra everything concoction every day.  I would love to volunteer at a shelter like you, but I think it would break my heart.  I think about just taking the cat and getting her secretly fixed, lol.""
A: ""The shelter I volunteer at don't euthanize. We keep them until they find a home. That's my favorite thing about it. I'm not afraid to pull money out of pocket to feed the animals, either. It's a passion. They're scared animals. ""

A: ""She's 26. What other instruments do you play?""
B: ""Guitar, violin, flute. Do you play any instruments?""
A: ""No, I used to play the banjo. Now I play basketball.""

B: ""I don't think so, but I may change my mind in the future. Do you have a company you think you would like to work for?""

B: ""Nice. Do they live far away from you?""
A: ""No, not at all. We live about 15 minutes apart. The practice is about 25 minutes from my home.""

B: ""Definitely architecture! How are the studies going?""
A: ""They are going well. I have a big final in one of my advanced Engineering classes coming up soon.""
B: ""That is great! I'm always impressed with how well you do. Did I tell you your sister dropped by last week to play music? Me on the guitar, she on the piano. ""
A: ""No, you had not. I bet it sounded great. I've been thinking I should start playing my banjo again after my classwork dies down. Did you every take a break from playing guitar and struggle to gain your skills back?""
B: ""Oh my gosh, yes. It's like riding a bike though. We should all get together and have a jam session. No Mozart, I promise :-D""
A: ""That sounds amazing. And I agree on the no Mozart part, I don't think my fingers would be able to handle that skill level yet. Do you know any songs with guitar, banjo and piano parts?""

A: ""My sister is going to be by next week and can jam with us.""
B: ""That's awesome! Will she be playing the keyboards or a different instrument? ""
A: ""She will be playing the same old piano. Honestly i like it the most. She is amazing with her piano skills. I dont know how someone can still get better when they are so good. I bet you know""
B: ""Yes. I'm not one of those people who underscores customer service workers on surveys saying ""It could always be better!"" But I do feel that way about music. But sometimes better isn't always in a technical sense; often it's less technical and more soul...especially with guitar. Piano and flute require quite a lot more accuracy, not as forgiving in my experience. ""
A: ""I know i am talking to an expert here! I wish i could be better in the music field. You know the irony about being a muscian that you have to be soooo careful with your fingers. I guess I use that excuse when I wasn't my best at basketball. Anyway, i am excited to see my sister. How about your sis? Any plan on meeting up?""
B: ""That's very introspective of you! No, Carmen is still in San Diego. I probably won't see her again for a while. Did you have your big final yet or no?""
A: ""Oh I wish you guys can hang out soon. Don't get me started on my FINAL!!! It is in 3 weeks actually.I feel i am so doomed. I totally needed more time! But I guess my pressue level has been way too unhealthy so having a break to jam with family will probably save my sanity lol""
B: ""Definitely. Making music helps me do other things -- give my brain a break so I can go back in refreshed. At least you do have the three weeks! I'm sure you're not doomed, although I understand the feeling. Finals are stressful!""
A: ""Oh i almsot forgot to ask! any good places to rent pianos? My sis asked me and i totally forogot...""
B: ""I would go local if you can! They're usually much more affordable to rent locally than those chains that charge you an arm and a leg for drop off and pickup. I'd call the local music stores. If they don't rent them out, they probably will have a recommendation about the best place to try.""
A: ""oh ok i'll pass that to my sis. She is just trying to help out her friend. Anyway, have you been following the news  on the shaky building in China? It's so bizarre that it shoke for no reason for 5 consecutive days! i would be scard to death if i  worked there!""
B: ""No, I haven't heard anything about that, but that sounds terrifying! And with all these instruments around, I feel like the shaking would create its own ominous soundtrack.""

A: ""I love conversing in Spanish, let me know when you feel ready to hablar! Life has been so crazy for me I haven't finished packing for my move in yet!

B: ""Hmm, well I have an idea - maybe we can all go hiking on one of the local trails? See how it goes; if he likes it maybe we can attempt one of the easier slopes later on in the future. But yeah definitely a very picturesque setting, you'll remember being at the summit of a mountain for a long time! ""

A: ""I bet it was! Everything I have heard or read about climbing Mt. Everest has sounded so challenging. Right now my boyfriend and I have been somewhat enjoying throwing a frisbee around.

B: ""Ahhh, so I guess he is an avid David Attenborough documentary watcher then. Yes, I knew he hated hiking, but I thought maybe he liked camping, or adrenaline pumping activities like sky-diving or base jumping. There is more to the outdoors than just hiking!""
A: ""Maybe you can convince him to come hiking with us! I think he is tired of hearing my try to change his opinion.""
B: ""Some people are just set in their ways. To be honest, that is what makes having a connection with someone all the more enjoyable - hearing about the things that they enjoy and are passionate about. I am sure he actually likes hearing your enthusiasm.""

A: ""How's your car collection? Any plans on getting something new?""
B: ""I'm a lot more likely to get more fish than I am to get more cars! The wife still isn't supportive of my car collecting. ""
A: ""Well, maybe if you collect enough fish, she'll decide it'd be better to get more cars, rather than more fish. Lol. ""

A: ""Wow that’s great! No it isn’t hard. Skating takes a lot of time but I could definitely find someone patient and willing the come watch and be supportive. You should try skating after having the baby!""
B: ""that would be cool, like your own fan section!! I think i'd like to try skating! having healthy hobbies and being in shape is important to me. might be something my family can all do together once the baby is big enough. when did you first start skateboarding? as a kid?""
A: ""Yes I was 10 years old when I started skating. It has grown on me and I haven’t been able to stop. ""
B: ""That's awesome. it's so cool there's something you've loved like all your life! do you have to cross train for it or does the sport itself serve as enough workout to prep you and keep you safe/healthy?""
A: ""It is enough workout to keep me safe/healthy. You should definitely make it a family thing. ""
B: ""i'll have to give It a try. do you ever skateboard with kids?""
A: ""Have you already made a gender party?""
B: ""No way!  I don't want to know until birth, as long as the baby is healthy the gender does not matter to me. ""
A: ""I envy you. I don't think i could wait. Is the pregnancy going well? Are you feeling okay?""
B: ""Yes it has been going quite well lately and the hubby is so supportive.  I've been walking the park daily and trying to continue to eat healthy.  I can't wait to meet the baby! ""
A: ""You guys will make great parents! Do you have names ready?""
B: ""Yes, we've chosen the name Parker, as it was my husband's grandfather's middle name.  And because it's unisex the gender of the baby won't matter.  We plan on having a baby shower after the baby is born, to introduce them to the world!  It would be great if you cold make it, I will be sending out invites about a month before.""
A: ""I would love to attend. It would give me and you husband time to talk babies and skateboarding. ""
B: ""Definitely! Maybe you can help to hang the skateboard in the baby's nursery too!  How has X Games prep been going?  As soon as they baby can walk I know my hubby will be asking you to come over and give some lessons.""
A: ""It's going slowly. My arm still isn't 100%. I  can't miss the X games!""
B: ""Just take your time, follow the doctor's orders and you will get there.  Where are the X Games being held?  I'd love to come check them out if I can.""
A: ""They are in Aspen. You should come. I need some support!""
B: ""That sounds incredible! I know my husband would love to bring our future skater Parker along too""

B: ""He's a lovely persian black cat with most beautiful orange eyes... is the love of my life I've had him for almost 14 years now""
A: ""He sounds like a wonderful cat. Does he like to nap?""
B: "" Yea given his age I'd say he spends over 16 hours sleeping these days. But he still plays, runs and will spook you every time. He makes me happy and also likes to eat pizza with me LOL""
A: ""That is awesome. I never knew cats could eat pizza! Do you ever take him with you when you go to the beach?""
B: ""I give him the crust and some beef toppings only haha. We tried once but he didn't like to walk on the sand. Otherwise he does like to go on walks with me""
A: ""Oh okay, that makes sense. Do you and Spook go on walks often?""
B: ""Almost every weekend during the Summer and whenever it's not cold or raining. I'm also aware of his age so I try not to push him too far. Any reason you don't have a pet by the way?""
A: ""The apartment that I live in don't allow pets unfortunately. Maybe I will move into a pet friendly apartment and get one at some point. Have you ever had other pets?""
B: ""Oh that's unfortunate. That was my main search criteria when I was looking for a new condo a few years ago. Yes, I've had. 2 dogs and 2 cats that have crossed the rainbow bridge""
A: ""Oh I see. So you are both a dog person and a cat person?""
B: ""I was a dog person before. It's not like I don't like them anymore, but rather I have developed this deep connection with cats more. So any future pets would likely be a cat :)""
A: ""So what do you do on the computer? Do you play games?""
B: ""Yes, I love to play games on the computer. It's funny, when I play games on the computer it is like Spook my cat enjoys watching. Lol. What games do you play on the computer?""
A: ""That's the cutest thing ever! What kind of games do you play? I don't play any games, I mostly use my computer for freelance work for extra side money. I do a lot of transcription work. ""
B: ""Oh, freelancing is such a good idea! I'm sure you really enjoy that kind of work. Lately, I have really gotten into that game called 'Among Us.' It is just super addicting. It sticks that your apartment won't allow you to have pets. I really think you would enjoy a cat.""
A: ""I enjoy it a lot. I've heard about Among Us but I've never played. Yeah, it does stink! How has work been for you?""
B: ""It has been super busy. They always want me to pick up extra shifts and my boss just drives me nuts but, I guess it could be worse. How is work at the coffee shop going?""
A: ""That sounds tough. I'm sure it's good for the extra money, but make sure you take care of yourself and don't push yourself too much. I get burned out so quickly when I'm overworked.

A: ""Hey...didn't you say Ohio was boring? Haha, I'm just kidding! I'm sure it would be a lot less boring with the company of a good friend. That's not a bad idea. Maybe we can play a visit over the summer? I'll have some vacation time in June.""
B: ""That sounds great! I will have to start thinking about what we should do... so it not so BORING...haha""
A: ""I look forward to it and I can't wait to meet Spook. Maybe I can try that pizza you like so much. Do you have a favorite pizza shop? ""
B: ""Yeah, their is this little joint just down the street from me. It is super hard to get a table so, I will have to make early reservations but the pizza is to die for. Also, I know you like Chinese food so, I will have to find us somewhere to near me to grab some Chinese.""
A: ""I found a pizza place near me today. I will try it out and let you know how it is so that I can bring you there when you come visit me if it's good. ""
B: ""Sounds good. Maybe we can go out for Chinese if that doesn’t work out. I like lo-mein also, and I know you love Chinese. ""
A: ""Your cat Spook would love the pizza from this place! I haven't tried a slice with olives yet; I ordered a white pie with broccoli and a pepperoni pie so far. I haven't found a great Chinese take-out place near me yet. ""
B: ""I think Spook knows when I call to order pizza. He gets excited when I say the word pizza. It’s going to be hard leaving him when I come to visit but I can have my neighbor Rodge watch over him. ""
A: ""Did you put in for time off from your job at the supermarket yet? Let me know when you're coming. I'll plan a nice beach getaway for us.""
B: ""Sounds good. I think around the 4th of July will be a good time for me. Did you get finished putting the solar panels on your house? ""
A: ""Maybe you could come on Thursday, July 1 or Friday, July 2. That way, we can rip it up all weekend, since the 4th of July is on a Monday. I'll have to work at the coffee shop that Monday for sure. I bought the panels, but I'm waiting on my friend, who does roofing and contracting for work, to be free to install them.""
B: ""Sounds like a plan I will make sure I’m off those dates. Going to the beach sounds great as well. I like doing things like that in the summer. I never travel so this is all so exciting for me. Maybe we can do some swimming, ""
A: ""Great. I heard that there are some nice beaches along Lake Erie in Ohio. We can go swimming, walk along the boardwalk with Spook, down some cold ones, listen to tunes, and have a jolly old time.""
B: ""Sounds like fun. I like drinking beer by the sand. Spook would love that as well, as long as he gets his nap time in. I think""

B: ""That sounds wonderful and scenic! I think I would like to visit both Paris and Berlin. Do you go to Europe for school or work related purposes?""
A: ""I go for school a lot because of all of the amazing art there.  Florence in Italy is especially loaded with all kinds of famous artwork.  They have so many different works of art from hundreds of years of history.  Paris is also great too.  What sights do you think you would like to see there?""
B: ""Ah yes I imagine there must be a lot of great and famous artwork to see in Italy and France. I want to see the usual tourist attractions such as the Eiffel tower. Do you have any art museums/galleries you like especially a lot?""
A: ""For sure the Uffizi and the Academia in Florence.  The Academia has Michelangelo's David which is just spectacular.  The Louvre in Pairs also has amazing art.  Which place in Europe are you excited to try the food?""
B: ""That sounds great. I am excited to try the bread and pastries in France. I would also like to go to Italy and try all of their amazing foods. Do you have recommendations?""
A: ""France has great food of course.  Italy also has really great food and I would highly recommend the seafood you find there.  It's so fresh and delicious.  Do you have any desire to go to England?""

A: ""I'm sure I will, theres bound to be plenty to see and do in France just like how much fun I had in Italy. I think it would be also a different experience as well.""
B: ""I bet.  I was actually on a short-list to go to Europe last year through the Equestrian club, but they only took the top 5 placed finishers in the youth division and I got 7th.""

B: ""I have though not quite as much as last year.  I had a non-riding accident that took a little to recuperate from.  Then high school has been a lot busier.  Have you ever been on a horse before?""
A: ""I have not, I'm a bit afraid that I might fall off and hurt myself pretty badly. I mostly stick to my bike, which I use to ride to almost everywhere.""
B: ""Maybe someday I can show you around the club and get you on some of the really gentle horses.  Bike riding is fun though.  Did you ride in Europe too?""
A: ""Yes, when I was in Italy I rented a bike and used it to get to different places. It was very relaxing and scenic at times, theres plenty of areas in Europe that is bike-friendly.""

B: ""No, not right now.  For the time being I'm worried about finishing up this school year.  But this summer I hope to go somewhere, even if it's just to a lake for some relaxation.  Have you been to any continents other than Europe?""
A: ""I've been to South America, but nothing major. Just some stops on a cruise I went on. What about you?""

A: ""What kind of training are you working on right now? Does he know how to come, sit, and stay? Roll over?""

A: ""I would feel guilty if I didn't give my own lab the same attention I give the dogs I train for work! Stay is one of the hardest for dogs. The best tips I can give are to pair ""stay"" with a release word that isn't come, otherwise you're always training your dog to come after he stays. First position the dog to stay, then vary the duration before you use the release word. Slowly introduce distance instead of always walking away. Start with no distractions, then add one or two like a toy or a sound nearby. Repeat ""stay"" if you think the dog is going to move. Don't use treats when he stays at first. Only reward him after he's stayed properly.""

B: ""I sure hope he does especially with the knowledge you have given me. My dog is an Australian shepherd, so they are smart dogs so he should learn pretty quick. ""
A: ""Australian shepherds are some of my favorite dogs to train. They're not just smart, they have the herding instinct in their breed, so you definitely have an advantage with teaching. They're beautiful dogs too. I trained one recently that had blue eyes. What color are your dogs eyes?""
B: ""Yes I researched a lot before I got him to find out what they are good out. How crazy mine also has blue eyes, and has tan and white fur. ""
A: ""I just trained a dog with blue eyes who has tan and white fur - he looked just like your dog!""

A: ""Howdy, I'm george. How are you?""
B: ""I'm great george, just set around braiding my dogs hair""
A: ""Oh, neat. What kind of dog do you have?""
B: ""I lied I do not have a dog, but do have a bird""
A: ""Haha, interesting. I'm not big on animals, but I do farm bees.""
B: ""Wow, you have seen the bees knees, I'm I mean I was a doctor""
A: ""How long have you been a doctor?""
B: ""Ten years, but now I am searching for a job because I got fired""
A: ""Oh no, that's unfortunate. Did you do something wrong?""
B: ""Making a video for americas funniest videos, while doing heart surgery""
A: ""Ha, they must not have a sense of humor. Do you like papayas?""
B: ""I do, and now I just watch my all time favorite movie friday, hey""
A: ""I love friday! I wish I had close family like that.""
B: ""I love going to the park. Do you? I like to trip roller skater with logs""
A: ""Ha, I mostly stay around my farm. You sound like a funny person though.""
B: ""Well, tell my old boss that, I like farms, I like to play with piglets""
A: ""Did you find a new job yet?""
B: ""I actually interviewed for a position at a local non-profit hospital.  It's a little bit of a commute but if it gets me working again, then it's worth it.  I forgot how nerve wracking interviews are!""
A: ""That's great.  Hopefully you will get the position.  What will you be doing if you get the job?""
B: ""Sadly, they've already said if they offer me the position it will be surgical consultations for heart patients only until I prove myself.  Once they consider me reformed, then I can go back to operating.  Not my ideal, but again, grateful for the opportunity.  Are your bees producing any honey yet?""
A: ""That's understandable.  But a start nonetheless.  Not yet, I am hopeful to have some soon.  I would love to sell the honey at our local farmer's market.""
B: ""That would be a great little business for you.  If it takes off, you could even look at opening an online business.  I have a few friends that work in homeopathic medicine.  Local honey is one of the best things to promote a healthy immune system.  You might be able to sell some to them for their patients.""
A: ""That would be great.  I have heard of the many health benefits of honey.  I try to use honey in replacement of sugar.  When I go to the farmer's market, I may just print a handout emphasizing the benefits of honey.  Thanks for the awesome idea. Been to the park lately?""
B: ""No, I figured it's probably better that I lay low for awhile and try to stay out of trouble.  Instead, I've just been researching and applying for jobs while my bird swears at me in Spanish.  How long have you been in the bee business?""
A: ""I have been playing around with it for about 3 years but just got real serious this year.  Yes, it probably is for the best to lay low.  Did you teach bird Spanish?""
B: ""It seems to be working out for you.  I'm sure you'll do well expanding the business.  It was one of my college frat brothers who taught the bird.  It drives me crazy.  I have no idea what he's saying.  My friend assured me that I shouldn't repeat it in public!  Any idea on how to deprogram a bird?!""
A: ""Thank you for your vote of confidence.  You might try talking to the bird and see if he repeats phrases you can say in public.  Maybe the constant hearing of new words will help.""
B: ""That's a good idea.  I'll make him learn surgical talk!  ""
A: ""Have you thought of taking a Spanish class, That way you can learn what your bird is saying!""
B: ""LOL!  Maybe I don't want to know!  Actually, you bring up a good point.  I do have a handful of immigrant patients and I think it would make a better experience for them if I understood Spanish better. ""
A: ""It can only help to learn another language, I would love to learn spanish, but man it takes a lot of time and effort. Have you ever taken a foreign language class?""
B: ""I actually learned French in school, but knowing it hasn't been very practical.  Maybe I will reach out to our administrator and see if I can get into a continue education class for Spanish.  I'm glad you mentioned it, because I think it could be very useful.""
A: ""I also took some french courses, but as you said, I haven't had much use for it. I really think learning spanish will help you in your  job search as well, how is that going for you?""
B: ""It's been slower than I like and I still think of myself as the Doctor I was.  That said, I have some prospects with St. Luke's in town and if not there, I am hopeful that Mercy Place may have some openings.  ""
A: ""Definitely, it is a tough time to find jobs, but you are in the perfect profession right now, the medical field. And as you said adding to your skills with a foreign language only makes you more desirable.""
B: ""Enough about me. How's the farm been?""
A: ""Not really all that great, we aren't that close, I think they get sick of the farm life.""
B: ""Ahh, well, how are the bees then?  I would be so scared to get stung, but you don't seem worried at all.""
A: ""I live for it, the bee farm is my passion, thats how you get by strictly using honey and not sugar your whole life haha.""
B: ""There are so many health benefits to honey.  I think I will probably end up prescribing it to everyone once I start working again.  Maybe I can send them to your bee farm?""
A: ""Have you had any luck in your job search? ""
B: ""I interviewed at a local hospital, i havent heard back yet. I used to operate on people, im looking forward to doing it again.""
A: ""Yeah hopefully you can. You were good at your job just made a few bad decisions. I hope you get the job.""
B: ""I hope i do too, i did make a bad decision at my old job. How is your bee farm""
A: ""Very well. Getting more honey than ever. I’ve made a lot of money at the farmers market. Also I got my own label I use now so people can recognize my product. Do you want a bottle sometime when I see you next? ""
B: ""I would love a bottle! Thank you! We should learn Spanish together, i heard you want to learn.""
A: ""Yeah I do. Maybe we will know what your bird is saying all the time!""
B: ""Yeah that would be great! I think hes swearing at me! I like playing with piglets, do you have any on your farm or just bees?""
A: ""No piglets but it would be fun to raise some. They are so cute when they are little. I don’t like animals that much though but piglets are fun. ""
B: ""It would be adorable to raise them, we should go in on some together, it would be a fun hobby to do together.""
A: ""Yeah it would be. Let me know how your job search goes maybe we can get together and celebrate soon and talk about going in on the farm together.""

A: ""That is great that you do that. How often do you volunteer? ""
B: ""Just a few times during the month. The company that owns the property shuffles through various services so that their clients are eating a wide array of things instead of stew all the time.""

B: ""I am jess, I've 3 dogs. I love dogs! Do you have any pets?""
A: ""I work part time at burger king to make some income""

A: ""It is and I will sometime next week its been hectic with school as well""
B: ""Where do you go to school? What is your major?""
A: ""I am in a community college near me""
B: ""That's great! Do you have a major?""
A: ""Hi Jess! How are your dogs and how is your dog-walking business?""
B: ""Hey Jane. My dogs are doing well and my dog-walking business is doing really well. How is this semester at community college going for you?""
A: ""To be honest, it's been pretty stressful. I think I underestimated how much time I would need to dedicate to this many classes. I think next semester, I am going to take one less class.""
B: ""That makes sense. School can be very stressful.  Is there any specific class you would drop?""
A: ""It's too late for me to drop any of this semester's classes without penalties, so I'm just going to have to power through. Wish I could drop political science though; I know it's a requirement, I just wish I took it when I had more time to dedicate to studying. You know, I forgot to ask you earlier - what are your dogs' names?""
B: ""I did not enjoy my political science class when I was still in college. It was so boring.  Thank you for asking about my pups. Their names are Biscuit, Gravy, and Simon Biles, which is the name of my favorite gymnasts. My dogs love to eat Burger King fries.""
A: ""I love their names! Do they come with you while you are working? Or do you try to keep them separate from the other dogs?""
B: ""I sometimes bring them to work. They are friendly dogs but it can be difficult to walk 4 or more dogs at once. ""
A: ""I wish I had a dog; I have tons of Burger King fries that I could share with them! You're very lucky to own a business where you can keep fit and interact with dogs all day. Was your degree in business?""
B: ""My dogs would love you so much if you brought them some fries. I love my business. I did get an accounting degree in college so running my own small business feels natural to me. I will likely start to expand and hire some other dog walkers. If you are ever looking for more part time work so you can move out from your parent's house, shoot me a message. I'm sure all the dogs I walk will love your Burger King french fry smell lol""
A: ""Wow! I don't know if I would do well in an accounting program; math is not my strongest area. But thanks so much for the offer! When I'm a little farther along in school, I might be able to take you up on it. I would love to have a little more interaction with some furry friends!""
B: ""I love math but not as much as I love gymnastics. The offer is always on the table. I know you are very busy and I respect your hustle. ""
A: ""I got lunch at Burger King one day and thought about your dogs.""
B: ""They would be so jealous! I've actually been thinking about expanding my dog-walking business to include a doggy day care; it would be awesome to have them at work with me all the time.""
A: ""oh that's great, what else do you like about your dog?""
B: ""Well, I think that each of them has their own specific good qualities. Biscuit is a total lapdog, always up for cuddle time. Gravy is a bit of a goofball and can always make me laugh, and Simone is my protective one. I don't know what I'd do without any of them.""
A: ""wow that's lovely I wish I want that pet too""
B: ""Well my offer still stands; if you would like to get out of the fast food business, you are totally welcome to pick up a part time job walking dogs with me instead. How is school going? Still struggling with that political science class?""
A: ""Yes I wish It would be over because it is very boring""
B: ""What is your favorite class that you are taking right now?""
A: ""My favorite one is Mathematics and I love it. What is you favorite?""
B: ""Oh! I thought that math was one of your weak areas; are you liking it more as the semester progresses? When I was in college I was a fan of economics, but if I get an opportunity to go back to school I would probably take a few more classes on animal health to better my business.""
A: ""Economics is also a great subject. Would you be interested in any sports activities?""
B: ""I enjoy jogging and hiking, but as a spectator nothing beats a good gymnastics match. I am absolutely astounded at the amazing things some people can train their bodies to accomplish.""
A: ""I just watched the national qualifier event for the USA Gymnastics team, did you catch it on TV?""
B: ""No, I missed it!  I had planned to watch it and then I go busy with something else and missed it.  How was it?""
A: ""It was awesome, I can't believe some of the routines that they pull off! Have you competed in any gymnastic competitions?""
B: ""When I was young I did a little bit of competitive gymnastics, but I didn't participate in college or anything like that.  I had just become a spectator at that point.  I wish I could have been out there, but I didn't have the ability or dedication for it.""
A: ""I bet it takes a lot of dedication. How is your dog walking business going?""
B: ""It's going quite well!  Thanks for asking.  We seem to be getting more clients and more clients sticking with us for longer periods.  I tell you, I am absolutely going to have to hire another dog walker to help out, and I'll give you right of first refusal.  No pressure or anything, but the offer stands, otherwise I'm going to have to look for someone. ""
A: ""I would love that! Thank you! What do you like best about the job? Have you ever had issues with the dogs not getting along?""
B: ""I just love being around happy-go-lucky dogs all day.  They bring such warmth and joy into life.  And yes, sometimes dogs don't get along.  But dogs are great because they can usually be distracted with some treats.  And in the worst-case scenario, I just have to struggle with them a little more than usual.""
A: ""I think I could definitely handle that! I love dogs, they all have such unique personalities. I used to not really want them, but once I got one, I totally understood why people love them so much.""
B: ""Yes, they're wonderful animals. And if you're a little apprehensive at first I would make sure to start you out with dogs that I know are really cooperative and get along.  I really don't have too many rambunctious dogs that I work with regularly.""
A: ""I'm sure you check them out before agreeing to walk them. So what made you decide to go with the dog walking business, rather than accounting?""
B: ""I like being outdoors too much to work in an office, at least right now.  But it's great because I get to use my accounting degree on my own business.  I don't feel like it was a wasted education.  I use it every day!""

A: ""Where were you? I would love to go to france. That is the next language I'm tackling!""
B: ""I just moved to the usa from romania.""

B: ""I take care of my stepchildren and am currently 6 months pregnant with triplets... So no work.""
A: ""Wow! Welcome to the usa! What languages do you speak?""
B: ""I only speak english. My parents and grandparents moved to romania from yorkshire when I was three.""
A: ""Well, at least you know english to be able to communicate here!""
B: ""Most of the townspeople actually spoke decent english where I grew up in romania.""

B: ""I lived in paris as an exchange student in high school. I hated the language barrier.""
A: ""How has unpacking been going? Are you settling into your new place well? ""
B: ""I miss Romania a lot but have been learning a lot about the USA.  Spain is my favorite though. You will travel there once you finish your language classes?""
A: ""I would definitely like to! Maybe while I'm there I could visit France for a bit like I've always wanted to. I'd like to learn more French before I do that, though. How did you like France when you lived there?""
B: ""Tres Bien! You will learn French in no time once you know Spanish. Paris has the best architecture in the world. What interests you in France?""
A: ""I've always thought the language was so cool, and I've heard great things about the beautiful countryside! And of course I'd love to see the Eiffel Tower. What makes their architecture special?""
B: ""Its so distinguished with the beautiful spires and arched roofs. At night it is all lit up. The Eiffel Tower is great, I just hope your OK with heights!""
A: ""Ooh that does sound really pretty! Heights make me a little nervous, but not enough that I'd skip out on an experience like that! Speaking of experiences, how has it been transitioning from Romania to the USA? What have you been learning and enjoying (or maybe not enjoying, lol)?""
B: ""Well, Romania is quite different but what I love about the US is all the different food here! I even fund a Romanian restaurant that has Uber delivery!  Have you eaten Romanian yet? ""
A: ""The wonders of modern technology! I haven't actually... what would you recommend?""
B: ""Wow, there is so much to love. However, if your going to eat one thing it has to be goats spleen stuffed with frog and spinach.  The frog is such a nice surprise when you the spleen bursts open! Doesn't that sound incredible?""
A: ""That definitely sounds interesting! Not sure if it's up my alley, but I guess I'll try anything once. What's there to lose? Do you cook traditional Romanian food at home for your family?""
B: ""I am not a very good cook. The last time I tried to make the stuffed spleen the frog was not mushy enough. Plus I forgot to take the bones out. Now I just order out. Whats your favorite food?""
A: ""I ordered some Romanian food today!""
B: ""That sounds good, if I may ask, what dish did you try?""
A: ""It was a baked chicken dish with really strong spices. It was delicious!!!""
B: ""It does sound delicious, I'm happy that you liked it. Did you order Romanian food just for yourself or did someone else try it with you?""
A: ""Just me. What are your favorite Romanian dishes?""
B: ""I would say that my favorite dish would be sour meatball soup, I had it all the time when I was growing up. I also like dishes with Mamaliga and Mititei as well.""
A: ""I will try those next! So, have you picked a name for the baby yet?""
B: ""I am still deciding on what to call them, I was thinking about Joanna or even Byni.""
A: ""Pretty names! You can't go wrong with either.""
B: ""Thanks, I am hoping to discuss it more with my family. I want to name my child a unique name that hasn't been used in the family.""
A: ""I have full faith that you will pick the perfect name!""
B: ""Thank you, I am sure I will decide on a name in time. I think traveling and living in Paris has influenced what names I am considering, as opposed to only thinking about traditional Romanian names.""
A: ""So What brought you to the states?""
B: ""I came over to marry my new husband, who I met online.""
A: ""That's wonderful! What do you miss most about home?""
B: ""I think just the familiarity of it.  You get used to a place and you like it largely because it's familiar, not necessarily because it's better.  And so now the U.S. is becoming familiar, and my husband is good to have around.  I'm hoping my parents can come over and visit soon, especially when my babies are born.  That would be nice.""
A: ""That makes sense. I would very much miss the familiarity of ""home"". I enjoy Romanian food. Do you cook? What is your favorite dish?""
B: ""No, I'm not much of a cook, although as I think I said before, my favorite dish is sour meatball soup.  How about you? What's your favorite food?""
A: ""Yes that's right. My favorite guilt pleasure is pizza of all kinds. I enjoy plain, with toppings, and everything in between! I can't get enough but I don't allow myself to have it too often. I do not cook very well, although I would like to learn. Perhaps when I learn Spanish I will travel and take cooking classes as well!""
B: ""That sounds like a great plan.  Do you like ice cream?  While pregnant I've been craving ice cream.  I think my favorite is Rocky Road or Butterscotch Ripple.  My husband has had to make a lot of late-night runs to the convenience store.""
A: ""I love ice cream!! Rocky Road sounds delicious, I haven't had it in so long. I'm sure your husband is happy to do something that helps you. You're having twins right? So exciting! Your role as a stepmother must be good preparation for having new babies.""
B: ""I'm actually having triplets!  And yes, it has been good to take care of the stepchildren, although I'm so big and immobile right now that their father is doing most of the parenting.  My feet and back hurt a lot.  I'm looking forward to having my children, although then it will likely be chaos on this house.""
A: ""Oh wow! That is such a blessing. I cannot imagine the chaos, but it will all be worth it. I hope you're feeling well, although I'm sure your body can be in a lot of pain at times. I know I was in pain with just one baby, nevermind 3!""
B: ""Yes, I'm a little scared about it but I trust the OB/GYN we found for me.  He's handled multiple births before and thinks everything will be fine, so that puts me at ease a little.""

B: ""Hey there rick, I am andy. Are you in aaa like me?""
A: ""Ah no I am not. Do you like to travel? My favorite destination is spain.""
B: ""I travel in the city. My meds make me see things some times.""
A: ""Sorry about that andy. How old are you? Sixty years am I.""
B: ""45. Stay away from alcohol, and if you can, buy a farm.""
A: ""Hmm. Perhaps I'll buy a farm when I retire.. Just a few years. No alcohol!""
B: ""Retiring as a teen? That is pretty impressive. What do you do?""
A: ""I'm sixty! Make a living as a librarian for boston college. You?""
B: ""Oh, okay. I thought you said 16. Sorry, I see things at times.""
A: ""Ha ha yes. How many meds do you take?""

A: ""I love books. Well I need to get back to work. You take care andy.""
B: ""Thank you, lunch time is over for me as well.""
A: ""Hi Andy. How have the medications been making you feel lately?""
B: ""They help me with my condition but it's like they take the life out of me. I always feel down and low energy.""
A: ""That's too bad. Do you think you might ever be able to get off your medication, or maybe switch to something that doesn't have the same side effects?""
B: ""I wish I could, but I don't know of anything else that will treat my condition. I've consulted with my doctor a time or two and they assure me that this medication is best for me.""
A: ""Well, hopefully you'll be able to get off it soon, or something better will come out. I've needed to take pills to help me sleep for years, but I switched last year to a brand that works much better for me.""
B: ""I do too. Do you have some sort of sleep condition or do you just take pills to make falling asleep easier?""
A: ""I don't have a specifically diagnosed condition or anything, I just find that I have a restless mind and I stop myself from being able to fall asleep because I can't stop thinking. My pills really help calm me down!""
B: ""I was kind of like that before my medication. I'd often think about all sorts of things come bed time, but I'd eventually get too tired to form coherent thoughts. With my meds though sleeping has never been easier ...""
A: ""Ah, the wonders of modern medicine! I'm glad it's been able to bring you some peace.""
B: ""It just makes me want to sleep all the time is the unfortunate part. Anyway, has there been anything new going on with you?""
A: ""I'm going to have a BBQ next weekend!""
B: ""What are you planning on making? Going to make a vegan option for any veggie who dares comes to the BBQ?""

A: ""I plan on ribs and brisket and potato salad, chips and salsa, and anything else I can think of in the meantime. No alcohol will be served but I'll have lots of lemonade and soda.""
B: ""that ok i don't drink alcohol because of my medication. do you need me to bring anyhting?""
A: ""You can bring something if you like but no worries if not. I'll probably be up all night thinking about the BBQ. I might have to take a couple pills to help me relax.""
B: ""try not to worry too much i'm sure it'll be a great success. ""
A: ""I guess you're right. Do you have troubles with relaxing?""
B: ""yes sometimes, i take medication to help me sleep""
A: ""Does it help? I think that's a fairly common thing to do in this day and age.""
B: ""yes! i sleep much better now but you should know! its completely normal""
A: ""I was doing some research on some sleeping medications, but I wanted to know what your stance/what you would recommend I do personally.""
B: ""I've been using Ambien for a while and it seems to do me well. It has made a huge difference in my life""
A: ""Wow that's great. It's such a great a huge difference I hope you can recommend it to me""
B: ""I just like sharing what's effective for me. I can't really recommend anything to anyone because every person is different. Its best to see a doctor and go through the pros and cons of each available option!""
A: ""I like that, thank you for helping me realize that. But I feel it has a lot of negative side effects I feel it may harm you in future. What do you think""
B: ""I think its possible, but it's nothing I'm worried about really. There are always risks to any situation, especially when it comes to medication. Maybe if you're feeling too uneasy you could see a homeopath. They might have a more natural option they can share with you.""
A: ""Thank you. May I ask, what's the main reason for you to use Ambien because I believe its a sedative drug. ""
B: ""Its for difficulties falling asleep. The sedative helps me get to sleep and stay asleep throughout the night.""
A: ""Okay. I think you can seek a medical doctor's counsel to give alternative natural ways which may not harm you in future. Also value your sleep and manage time well ""
B: ""Yeah, I think we discussed this last time. I already went to the doctor and he assured me this was the best medication for me. Although it makes me groggy sometimes I trust my doctor to tell me what's the best option out there. I've tried natural remedies but they haven't had any affect! ""
A: ""That's great then. I wish you well.""

B: ""Doctors say in two weeks.  I can't wait to get back to skating.  Have you been able to play hockey recently?""
A: ""I've played a couple of pickup games of street hockey recently. Almost fell a time or too and skidding along pavement isn't nearly as fun as sliding across ice.""
B: ""I have never tried hockey or ice skating.  Is ice skating difficult to learn?""
A: ""If you know how to rollerblade then you essentially know how to ice skate. If you don't ... then well it can be a bit scary at first. You're going to fall down a time or two but it's pretty easy to get the hang of.""
B: ""I should try it once my arm heals.  I love to head to the skate park with my German shepard but ice skating sounds like it would be fun also.""
A: ""I don't know if the owners of an ice rink would let your dog in, but if they did then I'm sure your boy would enjoy it. I like to skate around but I can't imagine trying to go up quarter pipes or skate on a rail.""
B: ""It is thrilling and usually a supportive group of people at the park to give you tips and such.  Start with small tricks and ramps.  I am sure you would get the hang of it.""
A: ""It seems scary. I've played those old Tony Hawk games and I know what's in store if you don't land your trick right. I doubt I'd be doing backflips off a halfpipe but even simple tricks can lead to mishaps.""
B: ""For sure it has some risk.  Just ask my arm!  It is fun though.  I can't wait to head back as soon as the doctor tells me I can.""
A: ""You must really enjoy what you do to suffer such an injury while doing it and yet still be itching to get back at it once you recover. I'd probably be the same if I ever took an unfortunate spill in a hockey match.""
B: ""When you like something it is worth the risk.  I am confident you would head right back on the ice if you took a spill.""
A: ""I visited a skate park and watched some of the skaters perform quarter pipes. Looks like fun. ""
B: ""Trust me, it is definitely fun.  Did the skaters who performed the quarter pipes seem like they had a lot of talent?""
A: ""Yes! It seemed like they were professionals! When you ride skateboards with your friends do you perform quarter pipes?""
B: ""Yes, doing the quarter pipes is one of our favorite ways to do tricks and jumps, which always draws a crowd. Is that something your character does when you play the Tony Hawk skating video games? Is it something you want to learn how to do in real life?""
A: ""Thats awesome! It is something I do frequently in the Tony Hawk skating game! I would love to learn how to do it in real life but I am afraid of getting injured. Is the quarter pipe one of the tricks that has caused you to break a bone?""
B: ""Yes unfortunately that is exactly what I was doing when I broke my bone. But it will not stop me from doing it even more once my bone has healed. Have you broken any bones when you are doing your ice skating? Or have you ever broken a bone in your life?""
A: ""At least you are brave enough to try again once healed! How long until your doctor releases you? I have not broken a bone from ice skating, but I did break my elbow once from a different accident!  ""
B: ""Oh no! How awful! What kind of accident was it? I've had a cast on my arm for a month so my doctor is going to take the cast off within the next month. I can't wait. So my doctor should release me from my time away from my sports very soon and I can't wait. It feels like I've been away from skating for years even though it has really only been about a month.""
A: ""I bet that the month has felt much longer! I am glad to hear that you will be back to skating soon! Have you been able to spend quality time with your dog during this time? I can relate to you because when I broke my elbow it was a trampoline accident. I was jumping on a trampoline with some friends and had fallen off. It was a very painful experience! I also had a cast on my arm for 1-2 months.""
B: ""Oh, so we understand each others' misery of broken bones very well it seems. You made a good point, I have definitely been able to spend more time with my dog during this time of recovery and wearing a cast. My dog is so empathetic toward my healing arm. I haven't spent much time jumping on a trampoline myself, but I always did enjoy the experience when I've done trampolining before. Do you still jump on a trampoline even after the crisis of the broken bone?""
A: ""I just went to the store and picked up a skateboard. I'm going to practice in my driveway.""
B: ""Congratulations! What kind of skateboard is it?""
A: ""I'm not sure to be honest. I got it from a thrift store. Once I learn more I will invest in a fancy one. ""
B: ""Thats a good plan. Ive seen that they have a life expectancy and its probably best to get used ones while you are learning so you can go through more of them. Do you have any hardware that you are looking forward to getting for it if you like the sport?""
A: ""I'm so new to it. Do you have any suggestions for me? ""
B: ""I dont but there are some good brands on YouTube that seem environmentally responsible and good for a budget. I'd bet one of the kits that has springs incorporated would be the best for a beginner.""
A: ""Thanks for the suggestion. Have you been skating long? How is your injury?""
B: ""My arm is healing well, I can feel it patching up and its a bit itchy. I cant wait to get these screws taken out of me.""
A: ""Ouch! I didn't realize it was that bad. Are you going to go skating the minute you can?""
B: ""I still skate right now but I stay on flat land so I dont run the risk of falling. Im on my longboard too which is good for balance.""
A: ""Wow. I would be so nervous to reinjure myself. Does your dog go to you with the skatepark? I bet hes smart enough to do some tricks of his own. ""
B: ""I was nervous, but waiting on the doctor ws getting to me because I also use my board for my commute. I hate taking the bus and need space so I found a route that has few bumps and areas where I can rest if needed.""

A: ""I'm not really a sports person, though I'll play volleyball every now and then for fun. What type of team are the Indians?""
B: ""They're a baseball team.  Since you love music, though, the Rock and Roll hall of fame I'm sure you'd enjoy. Wasn't Pink Floyd inducted?""

B: ""I think I'll do well.  But there's a guy out of France who is really good.  I've been studying some of his past games and the guy is a genius.  If I make through to play him, I don't know if I can win.  I'm practicing day in and day out to prepare.  You don't happen to play do you?""
A: ""I haven't played Chess since the summer of '69. I was never particularly good at it, but I do know which way the Knight moves. ""
B: ""Then you're golden in my book!  Sometimes I just need a ""fun"" game to play.  Would you want to play online sometime in the future?  It's a good way for me to relax and remember that I started because I love to play.  Summer of '69 huh?  Any chance you went to Woodstock?""
A: ""Sounds like it could be fun, count me in. I've remained undefeated for 52 years, just so you know. And I was there, yes - physically, anyway. ""
B: ""Oh, I sense a challenge!  Game on!  I bet you had a blast!  I've heard stories and seen footage.  I guarantee you I will never see an event that wild and free that could come close to the impact of that concert.  How did you learn to play chess? ""
A: ""Bring it. And as crazy as it was, I think it gets hyped up a bit. It was basically just a three-day field party. I learned to play chess by being forced to live in isolation in Alabama by my 'pa. ""
B: ""More like a mud fest from what I heard.  Rural Alabama I assume?  That can be a little rough.  My dad wanted to teach me strategy at an early age.  We always played after dinner....but I guess it's paying off.""
A: ""Haha yeah, that's pretty accurate. Rural Alabama indeed. No siblings, 'ma left, 'pa was always working. It was either Chess or staring at the field in those days. That's a nice way to learn though, and it definitely is paying off! It's a big deal just to be good enough to play in the National Chess Tournament, great job.""
B: ""Better to play chess than run through those fields.  Snakes and gators, no thank you!  Thank you for that.  That means a lot.  I wish you could fly out to watch!""
A: ""Do you feel ready for the upcoming chess tournament? Be sure to let me know how it goes and how San Francisco is!""
B: ""I don't how it will go but I feel prepared, and not sure about San Francisco, it is not a city where people eat a lot of meat. ""
A: ""I am so glad you feel prepared! You have put in a lot of hard work so, I know you are going to do great. Just make sure you get a good meal the night before and get a good night sleep. I believe in you! ""
B: ""Yeah, maybe I could teach you some chess strategies ? It would help me for my tournament.""
A: ""I definitely am willing to help you but, I don't think I compare to any of those online chess programs you have been using. Those thing are amazing and for me impossible to beat. I don't know how you do it.""
B: ""Those online tools have all the same strategies. It is easy when you know them. I could show you if you want to. ""
A: ""Yeah, I would love to learn. Oh by the way, I want to let you know that while I have never been to San Francisco a buddy of mine said their fusion food is to die for. I know you like cooking for yourself but, if you get a chance to go out one night you should definitely check out a fusion restaurant. ""
B: ""That could inspire me to learn new recipes. I was feeling a little bored with my meals lately. What is your favorite meal ?""

A: ""Okay, that sounds great! Maybe you could send me one of your favorite recipes and I will let you know what I think.""

A: ""I bought the ingredients you told me about and made myself Ramen.""
B: ""Did it turn out well?""
A: ""Well, you can't really go wrong with Ramen... but I think I may have gone wrong with Ramen. I think I need some more practice. Any suggestions?""
B: ""Getting a Ramen cooker helps. Keeps the noodles at the ideal amount of doneness.  ""
A: ""Oh, that is a better suggestion than I was expecting! I thought you were going to suggest going back to instant ramen for a little while. I'll definitely buy a Ramen cooker instead. Is there a certain brand you recommend, or the best store to purchase one at?""
B: ""I bought mine on Amazon. I like the one that I have. It's a Suzuki.  But compare prices and features, and I'm sure you'll find one that will suit your needs.""
A: ""I wouldn't know what features are most important with cooking. I'll definitely check out the Suzuki one on Amazon. And I can get it here in two days so that's a plus! Thanks! ""
B: ""You are welcome! All this talk about Ramen is making me hungry.  I've been playing so much chess that I forget to eat sometimes.""
A: ""Ahh, what food are you craving? Meat and fish would be my guess. The more we talk about food the hungrier I get as well.""
B: ""Yes, definitely some meat.  If I don't eat enough meat I can't think straight.  Not a good thing in a chess tournament. And some ramen of course!""

A: ""I definitely understand.  I am really busy with baseball, but we do try and help out around the community. My oldest son and his team actually did their volunteer work at the humane shelter.""
B: ""Nice! I feel so sorry for all the animals at the humane shelter. I wish more people would not only volunteer to work but help advertise all the animals needing homes. Do you plan on getting any pets in the future, maybe from the human shelter?""
A: ""We have thought about it a lot.  With the baseball becoming almost a year round thing, we didn't feel we had the right setup to get a pet.  Maybe when the youngest gets to high school we can finally get a dog.  ""
B: ""I totally understand. You are so busy with your boys that it makes sense to wait until you have more time to care for a pet. I can imagine the time demands with so many sons. I hope you give yourself time to relax. I find that a glass of wine in the night is really good for relaxing. I remember you like wine too. Which do you prefer, red or white wine?""
A: ""Red....all the way!  In the morning I need all the coffee caffeine boost I can handle, but you are right, I need to unwind with a good wine.  It's usually cabernet sauvignon.""
B: ""EXCELLENT! Cabernet Sauvignon is my favorite as well, especially for relaxing in the night. About the only time I drink white wine is during dinner if I'm eating fish and chicken dishes. I'm hear you on the coffee. Best way to get energy in the morning. For coffee are you a cream and sugar person or do you like it black, or something else?""
A: ""I would pretend to be macho and go all black, but I can't get enough of my sweeteners. It's usually 2/3s coffee and 1/3s cream (any flavor will do).  What about you?""
B: ""Yep, about the same. The cream adds to the smoothness, and then just the right amount of sugar to give it that little extra boost! How many cups of coffee do you drink a day? I imagine as a coach you need to stay alert to manage all the sporting details, and the caffeine must help with staying alert.""
A: ""I am almost afraid to go there!  I have a couple in the morning as a pick-me-up.  Then probably a couple more.  I traded one vice for another, but I find that this is less disgusting than when I chewed tobacco!  ""
B: ""Ha ha! Not me, I just do the one cup of coffee in the morning. Funny you mention chewing tobacco. I tried that once and it gave me a buzz, but not the good kind of ""alert"" buzz that coffee gives. In fact I felt sick afterwards. Glad you switched to coffee. You and I have a lot in common in terms of drinks!""
A: ""I tried a new coffee I picked up from the store recently, I want to tell you about it. ""
B: ""That's great I love coffee too. What have you tried?""
A: ""It was a new organic one we found at the store.  It will say it really helped and it felt like I had more energy than the coffee I was previously using.  The flavor was different but in a good way, I think I'm going to stick with it for a while.  Have you had any new coffee?""
B: ""I had an Chinese one which tastes good and it contains some herbs to which makes us feel fresh""
A: ""Oh nice, I'll have to look for that kind.  Did it give you more energy throughout the day?""
B: ""yes It keeps me active throughout my whole day. Do like any other drinks?""
A: ""I have tried to a new wine that had a little coffee infusion in it.  It was different and I don't think I liked it.  I prefer my wine to help me fall asleep as night and wind me down.  Have you tried any new wines or other drinks yourself?""
B: ""I have tried an asian drink called Tea which works as well as coffee but with more energy concentration and it doesn't have caffeine which is bad to health""
A: ""Yeah true, I should probably try to steer away from so much caffeine, it's hard though when I'm chasing all my kids around all day.  I feel like I need to try some alternatives to help with my health but not so much caffeine.  Do you have a Tea or flavor that you enjoy?""
B: ""I like herbal tea because it keeps me active and keeps my mind calm and good. ""
A: ""Oh nice, yeah I'm gonna have to go pick some up next time I go to the store!  I can't wait to try some.  If it helps you when you have all those cats and animals to take care of, maybe it'll help me with my kids haha.""
B: ""yes I hope you like it ""
A: ""My youngest son just brought home a stray kitten. I don't think we'll keep it but we are going to foster it. ""
B: ""That's terrific. Are you in touch with an agency to help alert others that the kitten is available?""
A: ""I'm not completely sure. We might keep it though, its orange tabby and I have a thing. Do you have any animals?""
B: ""I have lots of cats, I really love them, they give me as much as I give them. Having a pet is a great way to teach your sons responsibility. Who will be in charge of the new kitten?""
A: ""I will be, I'm just nervous it will tear up my furniture. Have you ever had a cat declawed?""
B: ""I'm not a fan of declawing cats, but there is a product on the market you can apply to the kitten's claws so it will be unable to claw the furniture.""
A: ""Really? is it like a gel or a covering?""
B: ""It's like a sleeve that you slip on over their nails. It covers the nails so they aren't sharp enough to damage you or your furniture. After awhile most cats stop clawing and you don't have to apply anymore.""
A: ""I never knew that, I think your convinving me to keep her. She's so cute and crazy. She'll run around the house doing laps as fast as she can and then just fall asleep.""
B: ""They are so adorable at that age! Have you determined if she is litter trained yet? ""
A: ""Oh yeah! thats the best part...I was nervous about that since she was always an outside cat but as soon as I put the litter box down she ran into it and went.""
B: ""That's one of the great things about cats, they are clean by nature and take quickly to a litter box. Have you set up her first vet appointment?""

B: ""What type of sport? I've coached kids for years.""
A: ""One was baseball, the other basketball. Probably why I love to run now.""

B: ""The next game is next Tuesday if the weather permits.""
A: ""Do you have a backup plan for what to do in case it rains?""
B: ""If it rains we will reschedule the game for later in the week. ""
A: ""What do you enjoy most about coaching your team?""
B: ""What I enjoy most is seeing the kids happy.""
A: ""That sounds rewarding. What is a typical week of coaching like? Does it take much time?""
B: ""I have to leave work early at least once a week to coach. I enjoy working with the kids and seeing them improve.""
A: ""When the pain of my diagnosis is past I might look in to working with kids perhaps tutoring or coaching. Do you have any recommendations on how to approach that?""
B: ""I would look online to see if there is currently any positions available in your area.""
A: ""I considered this before but I was nervous that I might not be good enough.""
B: ""I'm sure you would enjoy it if you gave it a chance and stopped thinking negative.""
A: ""How long have you been coaching kids?""
B: ""ive been coaching kids for 5 years now.  Its so much fun.  ""
A: ""That's awesome, do they pay you to couch or is it a volunteer sort of thing?""
B: ""It started as volunteer and now its paid.  Its not much but it helps.  Even though I love it so much I would do it for free.  Don't tell them that though.""
A: ""I understand haha, that's very altruistic of you. Do you have any children in particular that stick out as being excellent players?""
B: ""I have a few that really excel.  I see NHL all stars in their futures.  But there are some that still need work.  I can tell they don't take it as seriously as they should.""
A: ""Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that though, some people just play the sport for fun.""
B: ""I am all for having fun, and they are, but there are a few that dont want to be team players and slack off.  I want them to do well but I just cant seem to motivate them.  Do you have any ideas?""
A: ""I wish I did, my parents were both really into sports but I wasn't so much, I think some people just don't have the drive and there's nothing you can do to instill it in them.""
B: ""I know their parent want them there and I really want them to do their best.  I wish i could talk to their parents about it and not sound too harsh.""
A: ""I'm sure there's some way you can bring it up that's both appropriate at getting your point across, and doesn't sound too harsh, just be honest with them.""
B: ""Ill give that a try.  but enough about me.  How have you been doing?""
A: ""I'm terrible at fishing, but I just received good news regarding my treatment!""
B: ""I'm not the best at fishing, either. I get really mad when a turtle snaps my line. Haha. What's the good news?""
A: ""I am officially cancer free! It has come back before, but I'm really hoping it's gone for good this time!""
B: ""That's great news!! So you're practically in remission. What kind of job are you wanting that involves working with kids?""
A: ""I don't know. I always wanted my own kids. I'm not sure it would be a good idea to adopt since I'm on my own, and it's always possible the cancer would return, but I was thinking of maybe becoming a foster parent. That way I could at least help kids in need and has some experience being a parental figure and mentor. Maybe a volunteer for low-income families and kids in need as well.""
B: ""You can do a big brother program. I don't know if it's just boys, but they give kids an older sibling to spend time with and help them with stuff. Tutoring would also help many kids! I think you would be a great foster parent, but practice with children would probably prepare you and look better for the paperwork. I heard the process is tedious, though.""
A: ""The process is pretty long. It takes a while to be certified before you can even have a child placed with you. Normally the process is 6 months to a year and you undergo training. I definitely would be interested in a big brother program in the meanwhile. Have you ever been a part of that?""
B: ""I haven't. There are many schools in bigger cities that participate in it, though. I wish they would do stuff like that in the smaller cities. Most people are poorer in smaller cities.""
A: ""Maybe you should start a program. I bet kids in the smaller city would benefit just as much from a program like that.""
B: ""That's a good idea. I'm sure they would benefit quite a bit. I had a friend who had a ""big brother"" and it was an officer who would take her out to lunch and everything. It's someone who's there to help with school stuff and just be there. I think it's once a week they meet up. Maybe, more than that.""
A: ""That's awesome. Did your friend think that had a big influence on their life?""
B: ""I think she enjoyed just having someone there with experience. She was the older sister, so she didn't have anyone as an older sibling. I think she it did in a way. Sometimes, her ""big sister"" would talk about what she did that day and experiences she had been through.""

A: ""I do photography when I'm not teaching my elementary kids.""
B: ""I stream starcraft on my twitch channel, you should show it to your students.""

A: ""Okay, talk with you later!""
B: ""See you later, nice meeting you!""
A: ""My boyfriend and I have finally moved in, and it went well!""
B: ""That is wonderful! Now you need to design your decor. Red and silver look great on wallpaper. ""
A: ""I think that might work as well. How about you help me design some kind of gaming theme in my computer room?""
B: ""That sounds awesome. They have these wall stickers that you can just stick right on the wall. If your boyfriend doesn't like them you can just take them down. ""
A: ""What kind of designs are on the wall stickers? ""
B: ""They have gaming topics like a picture of a gaming controller or a mouse or characters from a game. Things like that. ""
A: ""Hmm, that's sounds interesting. I wonder if they have any actual game themes like Warzone or something along those lines.""
B: ""I don't know about that game in particular, but I know they have some popular games. Look online. If they are in red or silver, even better!""
A: ""I'll have to take a look then. You sure do like red and silver. Why do you like those colors so much?!""
B: ""Red is just so vibrant and alive. It makes me feel invogated. I just think silver is pretty. ""
A: ""So, when you were helping to make Starcraft did you try to include red and silver as dominant colors?""
B: ""Yeah, I pretty much use it in everything I do. Every room in my house has that color in it. Does your boyfriend like those colors? ""
A: ""I bought some new games for my computer. ""
B: ""Oh cool, what did you get? ""
A: ""I got warcrafts latest expansion""
B: ""Ha, does that count as a new game!? You said games, what else did you get? ANything new and exciting?""

B: ""I have not seen Pokemon Snap, do you have to play it outside likePokemon Go? ""
A: ""No. Its based on a track you kinda ride this machine while taking pictures. Like a slow roller coaster""
B: ""Ok, that sounds interesting. Im trying to think of new games to play on twitch channel, what games would you enjoy watching someone else play on twitch?""
A: ""To be honest id rather be experiencing the games and not watching them""
B: ""Fair enough, i enjoy both. When im not gaming i enjoy watching people play, but it has to be the right game! Im thinking about doing GTA V role play. ""
A: ""Well there is so much going on in that game, i think that one deserves a watch ha!""
B: ""Iv seen a few other people play it RP (role play) and it loosk so much fun playing as the police, riding around arresting people! ""
A: ""I downloaded the Twitch app, I'm starting to enjoy it. You're right, it depends on what game you watch.""
B: ""I'm glad you're enjoying it. What did you end up finding to watch? ""
A: ""People playing scary games. It's funny to watch them jump. Haha. What games do you record yourself playing? ""
B: ""Mainly starcraft because I helped make it, but I haven't been streaming lately. I've been trying to redesign my living room and that's taken up a lot of time. ""
A: ""My boyfriend and I have two different tastes when it comes decor. We're thinking about getting a two bedroom, so we have our own rooms. He gets to decorate his the way he wants and the same for me. I think he gets annoyed when I'm up playing games in our room while he's trying to sleep. What kind of theme are you making it?""
B: ""haha! I guess some people can't sleep through that. I would fall asleep to someone gaming no problem. Its so relaxing to watch. I haven't quite settled on a theme yet which is what is taking up so much time! I keep going through so many ideas and when I'm done designing it this time I dont want to do it again haha. Got any input for me? What should I do with it?""
A: ""Well, first off, why are you redecorating it? Too much red and silver or not enough? I think cute little lights that change color would be awesome. Maybe a projector to put on the wall, but you'll need a sheet or keep a spot white. Nice little futon, so it can turn into a bed if you wanna lay down or you have guests. A recliner, maybe. I like Charcoal Grey as a color for interior places, but that's just me.""
B: ""I was thinking about the projector idea. It would be such a space saver. I think maybe I'll stick with that aspect and go with a white box painted in the center of the wall and then maybe silver outside of that to accent the wall. I don't think theres such a thing as too much silver and red- but my friends disagree! I'm trying to tone it down a bit so people will enjoy it when they come to visit. Maybe the charcoal grey and silver would go well together thanks for the idea. ""
A: ""No problem!! I think that would be a great touch. I think you could keep the red and silver...just add the grey to it. That sounds a great idea! Another room saver is a wall mount for any TVs. I hate having a bulky entertainment center. Liquid gets trapped under them if anything spills. I guess one on wheels would be a tad better. ""
B: ""Yeah those bulky entertainment centers are so outdated. I mean some spaces are big enough you can pull it off, but they're such dust traps and awful to look at while you're trying to relax and watch tv. Do you have any new photographs you've taken? I've been thinking about adding some nature art to the walls to make it more inviting!""
A: ""I haven't been really taking any photographs. Between grading papers, writing lesson plans, packing our stuff, and finding a place...I've been stuck indoors for quite some time. I do need to make a day out of doing some photography. It's relaxing. What kind of robots have you built?""
B: ""That's unfortunate. My mom was a teacher so I know how intense those times can be. I can't imagine adding a move into the mix you must be so stressed out. I've been working on one that can bring me a drink from the fridge. He's been sitting there for about a month waiting on parts. Before that I was just doing basic ones that I could program to grab things or move back in forth in patterns. They were my build up to Fernando.

B: ""Yes, I guess 'fatal' has a new meaning, but I am glad you are here to be able to adopt all of the stray cats in your city. Just make sure your service dog doesn't enjoy chasing cats...or worse.""
A: ""Ha!  I hope my dog gets along with the cats. Otherwise my cats may organize and take out the dog.""

A: ""Yeah. Those guys are the worst. They made me crash! If I get cats like garfield though, my lasagna budget will be sky high!""
B: ""Well, if you cats like the one you had that swallowed the other cat whole, you may not need to buy food for them at all. You have had a lot of wild things happen in your life. You should write a book.""

B: ""If you can survive fatal heart attacks and the Russian mob, you may just be immortal. Do you let your animals in your BMW?""
A: ""Sure. I usually will only take like 5 cats with me on the road though. I mean I am not some crazy cat lady... 5 is the max you can safely take in a car without a brawl breaking out.""

I love Thai food, it's so full of flavors although I have to confess I do order quite a few pizzas! New York is amazing for deliveries. Everything is so convenient. ""
A: ""I know right?!  We just discovered a late night cookie delivery business!  They will also bring you milk and ice cream.  I don't know why anyone would not want to live here or in NY.  What about music?  Do you like going to live shows?  If so, the bar where I work, has live performances every Sat night and there's another great place that has live music every night.""
B: ""Cookie delivery! What more could you ask for. I do like live music. Do you want to catch a performance next week? I'm wondering if you'd prefer to go somewhere other than your work bar! What do you think? Are there any good nights coming up?""
A: ""Did you hear back from the school about your application yet?""
B: ""Not yet. I hope to hear back shortly. How is school going for you?""
A: ""school is so stressful right now. we are nearing finals and i am studying liek crazy.""
B: ""That's good though. How is work going? That has to be extra stress too.""
A: ""You have no idea... The bars get very crowded on the weekends and im always getting hit on by old dudes and its gross. But they tip very well if i play back haha.""

B: ""I am in banking. I work for a large multinational but it's pretty entry level. I want to move my way up but need my masters for that.""
A: ""That sounds exciting are you getting a masters in finance or are you getting a MBA?""
B: ""I feel like an MBA would make me more well rounded but I think a concentration in finance would show my dedication to the field. What would you suggest?""
A: ""An MBA might help you out with moving in any field within the company while the Masters will just get you further up in the finance part. But at the end of the day both degrees will help you move up. Just depends more on what you want to focus on. But there is a finance based MBA .""
B: ""That finance based MBA sounds amazing. I will have to check that out. What are you getting your degree in?""
A: ""What is your favorite kind of cookie? My roommate sometimes makes snickerdoodles. They are pretty good.""
B: ""I love pecan chocolate chip. I could eat 12 boxes of those at once!""
A: ""That's a lot of cookies! Maybe we should get a big group of us together and bake different kinds of cookies and stuff.""
B: ""That would be awesome. I was trying to think.. I don't know if I've had a snickerdoodle before. Whats in them?""
A: ""I'm not really sure to be honest.. I know it's like a sugar cookie but with cinnamon and nutmeg maybe? I'm not much of a baker, but I sure love to eat!""
B: ""haha! That sounds delicious. I didn't know if it was one of those cookies that people try to hide healthy things in like berries or fruit. That's not my style cookie at all! I love baking so when we get together I'll make sure you don't leave the egg shells in the batter! ""
A: ""Sounds good to me! I just need to find a night when I'm not working. Being a bartender in New York is a busy life!""
B: ""No doubt! I'm trying to do whatever I can for fun now in case I get into school next year. Doing my masters, I will feel that same full on grind like you're doing now. Got any good bartending stories? ""
A: ""Most of my stories are pretty run of the mill. I occasionally meet a celebrity or somewhat famous person but mostly it's serving drinks, cleaning up drunk messes, and trying to look like I'm listening to sob stories. The usual!""
B: ""Haha. Who's the most famous person you met/ were they how you expected them to be?""
A: ""Well I'm not allowed to name names of course because of privacy but let's just say that Pirates of the Caribbean actors sometimes venture in. Speaking of famous rich people.. you must get some at the bank?""
B: ""lolll I didn't know privacy extended to bars. You're a loyal server! I don't think I've ever dealt with anyone famous at the bank actually. Not anyone high key famous anyways. Just people with a lot of money or people who want to borrow a lot of money! haha!""

A: ""Hi I'm george how are you?""
B: ""Good I'm nancy. I'm enjoying the afternoon.""
A: ""It is a very nice day for bee farming.""
B: ""Oh yes. You are working on bee? How nice?""
A: ""Yes I work with bees. Do you work?""
B: ""I am still in school. I am the youngest and everyone spoils me.""
A: ""That must be nice. I do not have a lot of family that I am close with.""
B: ""I've four siblings. Maybe we can all visit your bee farm.""
A: ""I just have a wife, she is from italy and is a model.""
B: ""She must be very beautiful.""
A: ""I think so. She got me into eating papaya. It is my favorite.""
B: ""Papaya sounds so tropical. Where is your farm exactly?""
A: ""It is up north near new york.""
B: ""I would love to come over. Can I bring my dog?""
A: ""Yes dogs are more than welcome at the bee farm.""
B: ""Great let us set a date and I will make a visit.""
A: ""How's your dog doing Nancy? ""
B: ""He's doing OK. After a couple of days of resting and generally looking a bit forlorn he's bounced back to his normal self. Most importantly. his wet nose has returned. A dog with a dry nose is not a happy dog. ""
A: ""That's wonderful news. I'm glad he's back to his usual self. How was the bee farm?""
B: ""Very interesting. I never knew bees were so fascinating. They had hives with glass backs that were illuminated under special lights so we can look in see what was happening. There so much going on inside. Also I learned just how much work it takes to make honey! So many trips by the bee to make just a small amount of honey. I think they have caught my interest!""
A: ""Nice! That's really cool that they designed the hives like that. I wonder how it looks at night. Thanks for the idea, I may have to configure some of my own hives that way too! But yes, bees are very fascinating and such hard workers, as odd as that may sound. ""
B: ""Do you do bee rescues for people with bees nesting on their properties?""
A: ""Sometimes! In a rural setting, there's not too many neighbors for it to happen very often. But generally once or twice a year they seem to start nesting in a place they shouldn't be. I don't mind removing them for free. Saves some bees and adds to my colony. ""
B: ""I've watched some videos about this after my farm visit and I've some questions. How do get most of the bees into the transport hives before moving them? What happens to the bees that get left behind, do they die or can they join another hive near by? I feel really sorry for any bees that get left behind. Imagine coming back to find your whole community has moved. As you can see I am starting to fall in love with bees!!""
A: ""It helps to having a non-lethal freezing compound that kind of keeps them in place when removing and transporting the hives. We try not to leave any behind, but inevitably some do. Those bees tend to attempt a rebuild of the hive, generally in the same vicinity. Bees are oddly territorial so it is unlikely that they stand any chance besides that. But yeah that would be odd, it would be like the apocalypse for bees. And no doubt - bees are amazing critters!""
B: ""It never occurred to me that they would rebuild a hive. Can they do that without a queen? I've heard of hives that have lost their queens but never quite understood what the consequences of that would be. Does it mean the hive can't produce any new bees?""
A: ""They can, yes. It's sort of a little makeshift mini-hive, not really a full-blown hive. It helps when people follow-up that way we can come back later on to collect the stragglers. And it means exactly that - the Queen is responsible for laying larva, but an already-established colony of bees can technically sustain itself for a period of time, of course just until they reach the end of their lifespans. ""
B: ""I see, so if a hive is rebuilt in the same location then you can be confident they were from the original hive and collect them to be rejoin their friends. That never occurred to me. The bees certainly seem to be very resilient. How did you first get in to caring for bees?""
A: ""I just rescued a around 20,000 bees from a nearby farm""
B: ""Oh my! That is tremendous. How did you go about rescuing so many? ""
A: ""I found the queen bee and let the worker bees find the queen. It was pretty easy once you find the queen. Do you have any pets?""
B: ""That is awesome. I'd love to hear more about the bees sometime. And yes, I have a dog! She is a two year old pug named Peaches.""
A: ""What a great pug name. How long have you had her?""
B: ""I got her as a puppy. She was the cutest and chubbiest little thing. She loves going for walks and playing at the dog park near our house. Maybe you could meet us there sometime!""
A: ""That would be so much fun. What do you like to do in your spare time?""
B: ""I like to practice yoga, play piano, and read fictional novels. I've also taken a real interest in bees lately and have been reading a little bit about them. What about yourself? ""
A: ""I like to work on my bee hives. If you want to meet sometime, I would love to talk to you about bees. I am pretty knowledgable about them.""
B: ""I would love to do that! How long have you been working with bees? ""
A: ""Since I was young. I liked the honey and then it just developed into a passion.""
B: ""Yum, I love honey too. I love buying locally sourced honey from the farmer's market in my area. It just tastes so much better. ""
A: ""Would you like to get a jar of honey? The bees I rescued a while back ended up producing a lot of it, and I have much more than I can store. I have been giving it away to friends and family in the past two days, and I still have some left over.""
B: ""I would love some. Natural honey isn't pasteurized is it?""
A: ""No, it's right from my hive. It's really excellent, too. Some of the best I've gotten from them. But I just can't eat it all by myself and you know my wife won't have any! Can't risk the model figure.""
B: ""I've heard natural honey is really good at protecting people from allergies. Have you heard this too?""
A: ""Oh definitely! Locally sourced honey is one of the best natural allergy fighters out there. The fact that it's super tasty doesn't hurt either. ""
B: ""Maybe you can convince your wife to eat some for the allergy benefits!!!""
A: ""Yeah, she's pretty lucky in that area -- no real allergies. Must be her Italian blood. The honey definitely helps with my hay fever.""
B: ""I buy some at the local store, but I'll bet yours is much better. Maybe you can livestream your been operation sometime so I can see how it operates.""
A: ""Sure, I could do that! I'm supposed to go tomorrow morning to rescue a hive that set up shop in this lady's yard. She's not too happy about it but I'm thrilled to get more bees!""
B: ""How hard is it to rescue a hive?""
A: ""As long as you know what you're doing, it's not too hard, but it can definitely be time consuming. It kind of depends on the circumstances. The last one I rescued had gotten into the walls of the house so there was a lot of work that had to be done there.""
B: ""I can imagine. I bet you have a lot of interesting stories. ""

B: ""I didn't get the chance. The wind storm knocked down a branch that broke our fence, and Bessie got out!""
A: ""Oh my! Did you get her back?""
B: ""We did, but I was worried about her for a while there! Turns out she was just hanging out with the cows from the farm across the street from the outside of their fence. ""
A: ""That's funny.  She just wanted company during the storm.  What about your fence, did you get it fixed?""
B: ""It's good enough for now, it just looks a bit messy. I'm going to have to properly fix it tomorrow. ""
A: ""Does your pet have any friends?""
B: ""My cow Bessie is one of about 50 cows we have on our farm. I play country music for them while I milk them.""
A: ""That's so fun. Do they respond to different types of music?""
B: ""I think country music soothes them and makes it easier to milk them. Have you ever milked cows before?""
A: ""No I haven't... well I did when I was like 7 at some schoo field trip. Who's your favorite country artist?""
B: ""I am a fan of Garth Brooks, and Carrie Underwood. Do you like country music too, or another type of music?""
A: ""I like country. I am a new fan but I like Eric Church. Been into his stuff for some time now""
B: ""I have not heard of him. Almost everyone around here listens to country music. I guess when you live on a farm, country music seems to fit the atmosphere.""
A: ""Yeah. That makes sense. How many people work on your farm?""
B: ""Just family, my mom and dad and a few other family members. We have cows, and a few other animals and a big garden.""
A: ""That sound like fun. I wish I was closer to my family. Do you have any crops? Or just animals?""
B: ""I grow lots of corn for the cows to eat. I also load up my pick up truck with corn and take it to the farmers market.""

B: ""Yes, I never would have picked the two of them to go together, but they really seem to make it work. I don't watch American Idol much, for some reason it never really clicked for me. I really like the blind auditions on The Voice, it's great to see people given a chance completely based off their voice talent.""
A: ""Yes, I do like that about the show as well. A guy I went to school with was on the show but I don't think he made it to the live shows.""
B: ""That's really cool.... an almost claim to fame! I don't know anyone famous or almost famous.""

A: ""Probably getting Luna to say, even when there are tempting things she likes nearby, like tennis balls!""
B: ""I still have that issue with my dog. She does not want to ignore the toys. ""

A: ""I want to go to the dog park, do you want to join me?""
B: ""Yes I would love to! Any tips on getting Rowdy to stop tugging when he's on the leash?""
A: ""First off, we need to understand if there's anything making Rowdy nervous. Has he had any incidents recently when you went for walks?""
B: ""Not really. He sees other dogs and gets excited, but other than that no. He's always tugging. It doesn't matter if there's another human or animal in sight. We have to stop, because he'll tug at the end of the leash and choke himself. I try to keep up, but I want him to just calm down and walk beside me.""
A: ""That's frustrating. I think we'll have to work on ways to gently show Rowdy that you're in charge. Do you have any treats to reward good behavior?""
B: ""I sure do! I have some that look like little steaks and some that look like strips of jerky. He shivers a lot when he sees any other food than kibble. Does your dog do this?""
A: ""Luna is notorious for food discrimination! I have to be super careful with giving her treats because she keeps begging and begging. It seems like we both have a lot of work to do to train our dogs.""
B: ""My dog does the same thing!! Anytime I'm cooking he'll hop onto the back of the couch just so he can look on the counter to see what I have and what I'm doing. When I'm eating he'll stare at me and be very close. Afterwards, he's always sniffing on the floor. For like a good ten minutes. I don't know how to get him to stop.""
A: ""Haha if only we could get Cesar to help us out! I'm sure both our dogs would be trained in no time.""
B: ""Yes!! We all know why they call it The Dog Whisperer. How does he know so much about them? I get so frustrated sometimes. I can spend forty minutes trying to get my dog to lay down and it doesn't work. It seems like five minutes with the dog and it's well behaved. Haha. He's got a lot of patience. Very courageous for training aggressive dogs, too!!""
A: ""It must be some deal with the devil! Nobody can be that naturally gifted. Right...? Agh we'll both have to work hard to get these dogs in shape.""
B: ""And keep our souls doing it!! Haha. I always get freaked when there are aggressive dogs for no reason. Why would you want your dog to bite someone for no reason. Why would you want to keep a dog that you can't control? I don't understand that. ""

A: ""School keeps me pretty busy, what about you?""
B: ""Spending a lot of time running and getting resources for my new job""
A: ""Do you like your new job so far?""
B: ""Yes, I really hope to help people""
A: ""Me too, we should be friends!""
B: ""Sounds fun, it would be a great idea""
A: ""Well, I have to go train for my marathon. Nice talking with you!""
B: ""Nice talking to you, too!""
A: ""Hows the marathon training coming? How about the new job>""
B: ""Its going well although i don't like running in this heat , how is school going?""
A: ""It's going well. I can't wait to be finished though. Is it always hot where you live?""
B: ""when are you finished with school? The weather here is unpredictable in the spring""
A: ""I finish in June and then I am off until September. I can't wait until I graduate and can be a physical therapist. Speaking of jobs, how is being a life coach?""
B: ""I love it! I really enjoy helping people achieve their goals. I think that being a physical therapist would be very rewarding as well. What made you chose physical therapy as your career choice?""
A: ""It sounds like it would be a nice job! I chose physical therapy because I also like helping people and I like helping people to regain their ability to move and go out and enjoy life.  How is your healthy eating going?""
B: ""Really well , I am passionate about eating healthy , I believe it helped me to overcome Cancer. How is your 5k prep coming along?""
A: ""Thats great! It sounds like your a really positive person and it helped you succeed alot. It's going quite well although I wish I was making quicker progress. I can't even imagine running a marathon though! Was it hard to get used to running for so long?""
B: ""It was hard at fast but I developed a mantra in my head to keep me pushing forwards when i wanted to quit, after a while of doing that it got easier. Have you tried using a mantra?""
A: ""I'll look into it. I usually just listen to music while I run but eventually I get tired of that. Do you have any ideas for a mantra?""
B: ""The one I used was ""Not dead , cant quit"" but i think it's important to find one that fits with you. What type of music do you like to listen to when you run?""
A: ""I was practicing running the other day, and I think I was able to think of a mantra. I think it helped me run a bit better, but I want to discuss it with you to see if there's anything about it that I can improve for the next run.""
B: ""That sounds wonderful! What is the mantra you thought of?""
A: ""My mantra is ""Deep breaths and quick legs!"" it isn't as good as yours, but it works!""
B: ""I like that! Anything that fits you and keeps you going is a great mantra! Running in this heat may make me change my mantra to ""Am dead. Have to quit."" I am thinking of taking a vacation to somewhere cooler. Running relaxes me, but it's hard to relax when I'm sweating profusely. ""
A: ""haha! I am not sure I know any life coaches who have a mantra of ""have to quit"", very funny! Where would you go for vacation if you could go anywhere?  ""
B: ""Haha, for sure! But I can't be a life coach if I'm not alive anymore, and I am not a big fan of hot weather. I think I'd like to go to Maine or perhaps somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. Both places have some excellent seafood I can use to make some healthy dishes.""
A: ""Very good point! I am trying to think of somewhere to go while School is out in July and August. I want to stay healthy while on vacation so I can stay prepared for my 5k. Maybe you could send some healthy recipes my way?""
B: ""I would love to! Do you like to cook healthy recipes often? I love junk food, but I almost never eat it. I hate to run for miles and then immediately counter it with just a tiny bit of fried food.""
A: ""I do not cook much at all, actually! I eat at a lot of the dining halls at my school. I need to start cooking for myself soon though so I am won't eat out all the time once I graduate. My weakness is pizza. I need to find a healthy alternative to pizza!""
B: ""I love pizza! Cauliflower crust is a great alternative, but the good ones can be a bit pricey. Do you live on campus?""
A: ""Cauliflower?! that does not sounds good, but I will definitely give it a try. I do live on Campus, It has a beautiful running trail but I am ready to graduate.""
B: ""You just reminded me that there is an indoor running ""trail"" at my local health club. Maybe I will need to get a membership so I can run in the air conditioning. I never lived on campus for school. I feel like I may have missed out on some good and interesting life experiences. ""
A: ""I ended up getting a cauliflower pizza from a place on campus that specializes in it. It tastes alright, not as good as a regular pizza, but still pretty good. I think I wouldn't mind getting another one if I get the chance to do so.""
B: ""Wow that sounds really good and healthy. What is your favorite kind of pizza to eat? mine is broccoli.""
A: ""Wow, you are so healthy! I love a good pepperoni pizza but I am trying to limit my meat intake, so I have been trying spinach and peppers on my pizza, it's pretty good.""
B: ""Those are some very healthy options. What is your favorite place to eat on Campus?""
A: ""There is this really good pizza place called Pop's Pizza, I don't think they area franchise though. I will have to come back to campus even after I graduate just to get the pizza! Do you normally order your cauliflower crust pizza or do you make it at home?""
B: ""When I eat pizza, I usually order it on my cheat day but I try to stick with healthy options. W""
A: ""Where do you normally order from? Maybe there is a place for me to keep in mind once I leave school. What kind of meals do you eat on a typical day?""
B: ""I usually order from a place near me called Tony's. I usually prepare carefully planned meals. My favorite is salmon and rice. ""
A: ""That sounds delicious! Do you think you could give me a recipe? I am a terrible cook and I know I am going to need to learn some basic skills once I am out on my own so I am not ordering takeout every day.""
B: ""Of course, and my meals are all super simple and healthy. How have your preparations for the 5K been going?""
A: ""They have been going well! I have been out running with my roommate every day this week. I am really looking forward to it, hopefully I will be able to run a marathon like you one day.""
B: ""It takes a lot of hardworking and dedication to run a marathon. Do you listen to music while you run?""

B: ""Wow you work there a lot. I studied chemistry in college""
A: ""Things have been hectic recently at the restaurant, I haven't had time for the motorcycle.""
B: ""How long have you been riding?""
A: ""I've been riding motor bikes since my teens. I started riding off road riding motor cross and that's were my competitive edge for racing started.""
B: ""Oh that's cool, do you join competitions then? The bookstore was really busy yesterday, but not so much today.""
A: ""Sometimes I ride competitions like time trials but mostly it is straight head to head racing. I remember the last time we spoke you were very creative with rhymes! How do you spend the time when the shop is quiet? ""
B: ""Oh I see, do you have a race coming up then? When it's quiet I usually read some of the dog books or brush up on the sciences.""
A: ""My next race is next month! I've been working on my bike to get it to max performance. There's a lot of tuning and checking to do. I love dogs! Can you recommend any dog books for me to read?""
B: ""Good luck! I bet it takes a lot to repair your bike, do you do it yourself? ""Dog Years: A memoir"" is truly an amazing book to read""
A: ""Yes, I've been obsessed with bikes ever since I started riding them. Bikes are my passion. The restaurant is just a means to riding my bikes. Dog Years, is that the book by Mark Doty? My friend also recommended that to me. Maybe I should read it!""
B: ""Oh that's nice, I guess books are my passion, although you seem to be much more passionate about biking. Yes, that's the author. You should definitely read it, it helps you better understand how to care for a dog""
A: ""Have you got a copy in stock?""
B: ""Yes, two in fact. It's quite popular""
A: ""Do you have any pets since you love dogs so much?""
B: ""I do have a dog, she's a labradoodle named Leah. She's quite a handful but so very sweet. Do you have any pets?""
A: ""Labradoodles are great!  I have a dog as well - a chocolate lab.  He's a good boy, but also a handful.  Do you ever take Leah to the dog park?""
B: ""We don't have a dark park close but I wish we did. How has work been going for you?""
A: ""Work is going well - people have been very generous lately with the tips!  How about for you - any new book recommendations from the book store?""
B: ""I'm so glad to hear that. We actually had a busy weekend at work. We had an author come in for a book reading and that brought in a lot of new customers. ""
A: ""Well that's great!  Had you read the author's book previously?""
B: ""I had not. She only read a part of the book though, so I brought home a copy so I could finish. It's seems very interesting, it's a murder mystery novel. Have you had any time to ride your motorcycle or race lately?""
A: ""Oh, I enjoy a good murder mystery as well!  I have ridden my motorcycle lately.  I won't be riding for a while, though...I fell off and broke my leg!""
B: ""Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I bet that must make work really tough for you. Do you have crutches to help you get around? ""
A: ""It's been an adjustment, but I think it has been helping with the sympathy tips!  Actually, they gave me on of those scooters where you put one leg up and roll around, so carrying trays is a bit easier since it has a crate.""
B: ""I didn't think about sympathy tips, haha! That's awesome. It's stinks that you broke you're leg, but I guess silver lining you know? I'm sorry you'll miss that race next month. ""
A: ""Oh, my leg still borthered me""
B: ""I can imagine.  How long has it been since you broke it? I'm sure it will take time to fully heal""
A: ""It has been about a year, but it still bothers me to ride.""
B: ""Oh I didnt realize it's been that long!  Are you still on medication? Do you do physical therapy ?""
A: ""I do physical therapy but I still have to be careful because it hurts in my knee and bottom portion of my leg when I ride""
B: ""That's terrible.  Well, hopefully it gets better soon.  I know how much you love riding. Have you raced at all then, or just riding for fun.""
A: ""Just for fun but I have been practicing some for my races as well.""
B: ""That's good.  I'm sure you need to keep your skills up.  Riding for fun and for racing probably takes two different mindsets and skills.  I hope it all works out for you.  How's the restaurant going?  Still busy?""
A: ""Yes it does for sure. It is going really good and I have been really busy creating new recipes ""

A: ""That sound amazing! Not going to lie, I love 21 Jump street and Oceans 8""

B: ""Sounds like a great plan! What movie did you have in mind?""
A: ""Something with a strong female lead would be great, still thinking about the options. Was thinking of that new Oscar movie Nomadland recently, love that actress!""

B: ""I'm not sure, but I'm down for some shopping after the movie.""

"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""Hello how are you today?""
B: ""I am very well! Just finished tending to my bees with my wife.""
A: ""I wish I wasn't single, but at least I have my two dogs!""
B: ""I was single for a long time. Just married to super model from italy.""
A: ""Wow! I guess I am only in my thirties so I've time.""
B: ""I won't disclose my age but george is the name. Old name equals older.""
A: ""I've an old soul. Love bubble baths with a good book.""
B: ""Hold onto that! I will take my bees, wife and papaya. All of my favorites!""
A: ""It is good to have hobbies. I would probably drink alcohol if not.""
B: ""I'm not close with any other family and they are all that I've.""
A: ""Well it sounds like you are doing well. Especially with supermodel wife.""
B: ""I'm not complaining. Italy is awesome!""
A: ""My dogs are actually named after italian cities. Venice and milan.""
B: ""What type of dogs do you have?""
A: ""Two huskies. They're perfect. What kind of bees do you tend?""
B: ""The italian honey bee is what I'm doing now.""
A: ""My huskies have an appointment with the groomer this weekend. The weather is warming up, so it's time for a haircut.""
B: ""I agree.  Do u""
A: ""Do you have any kids?""
B: ""Yes, my wife and I have two boys.  Ben is five and Cam is eight.  Do you like honey?""
A: ""Yes, I love honey with tea. Do you ever think about getting a dog?""
B: ""I’ll send you some fresh honey from my hives.  No dogs for us, my wife is allergic to dogs and cats.  She is my supermodel boss!""
A: ""Oh that's so kind, thank you! Ahaha, right wives are definitely the boss. At least you have kids to keep you busy. The weathers nice so you can probably take you family to the park!""
B: ""True, my wife works a lot and am a stay at home dad.  Do you like to read while taking your bubble baths?""
A: ""Wow, you're life seems less stressful than mine. I'm a realtor agent, so my schedule is always busy. Yes, definitely, reading and bubble baths help me relax.""
B: ""A realtor, wow the market is so hot right now.  I bet you are super busy.  Maybe I can bring the boys over to see your dogs, since Sue is traveling all week.  What do you think?""
A: ""Yeah, the markets been crazy. That's fine by me! I'm sure my boys would love to meet your boys. Perhaps after their haircut over the weekend?""
B: ""Yes, I think the four of them will get along great.  I’ll bring the honey back and then maybe we can go out for an early lunch at that new restaurant near your house?""
A: ""It was so great hanging out the other day. Your boys really enjoyed playing with my dogs and thank you so much for that fresh honey. Did you enjoy that new restaurant we ate at?""
B: ""Mostly, yes. The service was not great, but I imagine they'll work out the kinks as time goes by. Plus, they had decent Italian options, my favorite. My boys have been begging me for a new dog since we hung out.""
A: ""Really?  What have they said?  Any breed in specific?""
B: ""Well a husky of course, but we will need to look into hypoallergenic breeds since my wife is allergic. I'm not sure since I stay at home. That means I will end up doing most of the care.""
A: ""Maybe you can adopt an older dog that will be trained already?  That way it will be less work for you. what do you think?""
B: ""That is a wonderful idea! Thinking outside of the box must help you sell homes too -- always a solution for a perceived complaint! ""
A: ""Yes absolutely.  Actually, I have an open house this weekend.  Do you want to stop by? ""
B: ""Maybe! I need to tend to the bees over the weekend once Sue gets home from traveling for work. I admire what you do. I think I would have a hard time in a commission-based industry.""
A: ""I don't think so, I think you would do great.  Where is Sue this week?""
B: ""She is in New York this week, but she'll be home in a couple of days. We are thinking of planning a trip to Italy to see her family. I haven't met them.""
A: ""Oh that will be great!  I am sure you will have a nice time.  Where in New York is she?""
B: ""She is in midtown on a shoot. I'm nervous to meet her family, and they don't speak English. I don't speak Italian, but she's trying to teach me.""
A: ""Honey bee keeping is such a unique hobby. What first got you started with having an interest of becoming a bee keeper?""
B: ""When I was a child I learned of how bees make honey and I found the process fascinating. I began learning then how to keep bees myself and eventually became a master! It is very enjoyable and rewarding. ""
A: ""They are really fun to learn how to take care of. So many people are afraid of them because they just do not understand them. My grandfather had beehives when I was a kid""
B: ""Oh how interesting! Is that where you got your love of honey?""
A: ""Yes it is. He would always take me with him and give me a piece of the comb and that is the best thing ever.""
B: ""Yes, I agree! Did you know that daily consumption of local honey can help with your seasonal allergies? Make sure you are using local honey in your tea!""
A: ""I did not know that. I will have to see if I can find some local honey. I do put it in my tea and it is really good in place of sugar.""
B: ""Yes, honey has many health benefits even if it is not local! Of course, I think local honey is the best, but I may be a bit biased! Have you read the book The Secret Life of Bees? ""
A: ""I have heard of the book but I have never read it. Is there a lot of good information in it?""
B: ""It is actually a novel! It is an fascinating story and that share quite a bit about beekeeping (and the benefits of honey) within the story. It would be a good read for you during your bubble baths!""
A: ""I will have to get the book to read then. I love taking baths and reading books. It is so relaxing.""
B: ""I am not a bath person myself, but I do enjoy reading a good book!""

B: ""Haha that is funny, he's mischevous. What color is he?""
A: ""I'd say he's mostly blue and grey. It's a really pretty color though.  I wish you could come over and see him.  When do you get out of jail again?""
B: ""Oh so you have your favorite colored animal as a pet, nice. I'll probably get out on good behavior in the next month.""
A: ""I can't wait.  You know we can work at getting you a cat when you come out.  I know you have a good heart and want to help all cats, but let's start at the humane society when you get out!""
B: ""Yes, that is probably a good idea, atleast they will want me to save a cat unlike the pet store.""
A: ""I know and it broke my heart when I heard it, but I'm so glad you will be out soon.  What do you miss the most since you've been in jail?""
B: ""I miss good food the most, a home cooked meal will be very welcomed. The food in here is terrible.""
A: ""I hope to never try it, no offense.  I will fix you something special when you are released.  Has someone been taking care of your mail since you were out?""
B: ""No offense taken. Thank you I'm excited to try that. No one is taking care of my mail, I have a PO box which is probably very full.""
A: ""I am almost finished redecorating my kitchen and I'm excited to move on to the living room next.""
B: ""Yeah bet it looks great I wish I could redocorate my cell here would be nice.""
A: ""I can imagine must be boring looking at the same old walls everyday.""
B: ""Yeah it is what I would give to spruce it up a bit and have a good home cooked meal.""
A: ""I would cook something for you but being in there not much I can do for you never mind though only a month and you will be out.""
B: ""Yeah hopefully will go quick for me now. Once i'm out and get a place maybe I could do some decorating then.""

B: ""Oh no! What color were the new curtains?""
A: ""They were beautiful striped curtains with white and cream stripes. ""
B: ""Oh, that's a shame. It sounds like they would look lovely with your brown walls.""
A: ""They did look wonderful. I am torn between ordering news just like them or going with something different. I am afraid the cat will do the same thing again. ""
B: ""Cats can be tricky that way, can't they? But so adorable.""

B: ""Oh yes.  I love the bravado and flair you guys have in the ring.  I am envious of your ability to interact with so many people.  Does it hurt?""
A: ""It hurts, but it's worth the money. What do YOU want to do for a living?""
B: ""Well it's kind of a coincidence, but I want to be a physical therapist.  Do you guys have a lot of them backstage?""

A: ""Are you going to have a graduation party this May?""

A: ""That makes sense. Don't feel pressured to have a party just because other people do. It's your graduation, do whatever makes you most comfortable!""
B: ""Thank you, I wish I could be more of an extrovert like you...have you always been outgoing?""
A: ""Yes, my whole life. But it's just different for different people. There's a great book called Quiet about the power of introverts. You should read it!""
B: ""That sounds very interesting, I'll look into it. Did you enjoy volunteering at the homeless shelter?""
A: ""I love it. You feel like you're making such a big difference. And so many people there are introverts! You should come if you want.""

A: ""Good idea. I'll drop a text and see if we can all find a time that works best for us. I'll give you a ride too. We generally go on weekend evenings if that works for you?""
B: ""That sounds great! Hopefully he won't think I'm weird since I'm so shy.""
A: ""What did you like most about Habitat for Humanity?""
B: ""I loved the feeling that I was contributing to building a home for someone in need. I actually really enjoyed hammering and sawing and all of the construction aspects of the day. I felt a sense of accomplishment in seeing what I was able to do.""
A: ""The hammering is one of my favorite parts too.  I like that I can pound on something without getting pounded back for a change, haha""
B: ""hahaha, do you normally partake in activities where you get pounded back?""
A: ""It tends to happening when I'm wrestling, being pounded into the mat and stuff like that.""
B: ""Oh my goodness, of course! What is your favorite thing about being a wrestler?""
A: ""The crowd.  The energy that they give off is a total high.  ""
B: ""That is so cool. I would have the opposite reaction, I would feel so nervous! One time I had to give a speech in front of my class of 200 people and I threw up into the garbage can, I was so nervous.""
A: ""That stinks.  I get to play a character when I'm wrestling, so it's even more fun since I'm not even really being myself.  I'll bet homecoming was hard for you too then.""
B: ""Homecoming was hard, but at least it is fun and I try to put myself into uncomfortable situations, otherwise I won't grow from it. It must be easier if you are playing a character and not yourself, maybe that is something I can try implement for times I am feeling nervous.""
A: ""I got my first taste for it in my high school drama club.  I know sometimes people think that drama is just for nerds, but it helped me to form my wrestling characters.  Maybe that's something you could try?""

A: ""I think it is a great dream and hope you do it after the kids grow up! You will never be too old to chase your dreams. ""
B: ""That's true. In the meantime, I do have quite a nice life with the family, the dog and the beach! Do you think you'll go back to Manhattan after school?""
A: ""Enjoy the kids and life you have while they are young! I am not sure if I will come back to Manhattan. I want to see what job opportunities I have after completing school before I decide. ""
B: ""With your interest in international finance, maybe even a career abroad?""
A: ""That would be very exciting to me. Even if I did it for a few years to work while exploring the world! I am even open to stateside. Like Florida, do you like it there?""
B: ""Well, Florida has it's benefits (like the beaches and the weather), but I have found it difficult to get ahead financially being based here. It's a great idea to explore and travel while you're young and free of entanglements.""
A: ""That is the plan for now. But I am always open to what life throws my way. Thanks for the advice on Florida, always good to know. Do you think your wife and you will have more kids?""
B: ""That's not in the plan now. The twins are quite a handful, so we got a dog instead!""

B: ""I really enjoyed ""The Staircase"", it's about Michael Peterson.  Have you seen it?""
A: ""No, I haven't. Was it any good?""
B: ""It was very good!  Michael Peterson was a criminal mystery writer who was accused of murdering his wife.  The documentary covers his story.""
A: ""Oh, I remember his story now. Fascinating stuff. Did you come to a conclusion as to whether he was guilty or not from the documentary?""
B: ""I assume he was guilty or he wouldn't have taken the plea deal.""
A: ""Interesting. I will have to check it out as I love that genre. Did you see Making a Murderer? Another fantastic crime documentary in my opinion.""
B: ""I've only seen the first season, I haven't had time to sit and watch season 2 yet.""
A: ""I didn't enjoy the second season as much to be honest with you. I found it to be a bit bleak and frustrating.""
B: ""That's good to know, I may take a pass on it then.  By the way, I have an opportunity to visit Colorado, are there any attractions you would recommend seeing while I am there?""
A: ""Denver Zoo is a pretty good visiting spot. The Botanic Gardens are very pretty too if you're into that sort of thing. As you've never been hiking I wouldn't recommend Rocky Mountain National Park unless you'd like a challenge. ""
B: ""I'll have to check out the zoo and I might check out the National Park; I've never been hiking, but I'm always up for a challenge and I have heard the scenery is majestic.  Can you recommend any local restaurants?  I like to eat where the locals go when I travel.""
A: ""I recently went hiking and found a great beginner trail that might be great to introduce you to hiking successfully. ""
B: ""How long is the trail? I don't have to worry about bears or anything, do I?""
A: ""Its about 3 miles round trip. Well you should always be aware but i have never heard of one being seen on this trail.""

A: ""I am enjoying going on hikes on Saturdays. My job stresses me out, so it is nice to get out and get fresh air to relax. ""
B: ""Oh, so you've made a commitment to every Saturday?  The routine must help ease the stress too!""
A: ""Yeah, first I go hiking and then I go sit in the steam room when I get home.""
B: ""Wow that's amazing. It sounds like something out of the movies to have a steam room at home!! I've never been in one before is it hard to breathe in there?""
A: ""No, it helps you breathe more easily. I spray eucalyptus in the air, too. It's very relaxing.""
B: ""That's so cool. It sounds like you have your very own spa at your house! Do you have any other things like that at home that help you relax?""
A: ""No, that's about it. Most of my time is spent working and not in the steam room unfortunately. Did you buy the camera yet?""
B: ""That is unfortunate. I guess to own nice things like that you have to spend a lot of time working to afford them haha. I haven't decided which one to buy yet. I have a few in my Amazon cart but I don't understand the difference between them. I think I'm just going to choose based on colour!""
A: ""I know nothing about that type of stuff either. Maybe you should try to match your backpack?""

B: ""I'm sure you're going to just fine!! It sounds like you're getting very prepared for when they come. It sounds like you weren't planning three at the least. Were you trying to conceive or did it just happen?""
A: ""Well kids were always part of the plan and we were trying for a few months, but we never imagine we would have triplets! I was hoping to have a boy and a girl like a typical family but now we're going to have an extra member!""
B: ""There's no controlling when or what gender you'll conceive. I'm sure you'll love them all the same. Three does sound like a handful, though. I hope your husband is the helping type! It does take a village to raise a child as they say! Have you had baby shower for them, yet?""
A: ""Yes my husband helps so much with the shopping and getting the house ready for the babies, he does everything I can't do and more! We were actually planning a baby shower for August 20th, maybe I'd see you there?""
B: ""That sounds great! I would love to come! Where will you be having it at? Since you've done so much shopping is there anything you need that you haven't purchased, yet? If not, I'll bring a couple watches. One for the lady and one for the husband. Maybe, both. ""

A: ""We didn't try to go with a theme since the three of them will be living with each other for while and interests might clash haha. It's a decently big room but luckily there were some small triplet cribs that connect together to fit on one wall. We also have a triple bunk for when they're older!""

A: ""If I survive the baby shower! Although it will be fun to be with all of my friends, I'm very nervous about having my family members around.""
B: ""True. I'm sorry about that. I know what it's like to not have your family have your back where it truly matters. I hope that this can help bring them over, though. They have to recognize that this whole family you're growing couldn't be without your husband's love and support.""
A: ""You've said it so well. I'm really looking forward to making our own family unit and setting a new culture in which my kids will always know they have my love and support for their life decisions.""
B: ""That's a really great thing to look forward to, and keep yourself motivated for. I want to do the same for my eventual kids, when they find themselves a job that they like. How's your husband been feeling about all of this? He's always so good to you. I hope it doesn't get him down too much.""

A: ""Well I will be thinking of you two! I'm considering it. We're trying to get pregnant with one more child, but I think if that doesn't happen in the next few months we might take in another cat. Especially as Ginger gets older, I want Baxter to have another companion. Do your cats get along well?""
A: ""I am pregnant! No more cats for me in the future, just two.""
B: ""Congratulations! That's great news for you and the family, although maybe not for the local cat shelter. ; )""
A: ""Haha, I guess not. Oh well, shelter cats have been in high demand these last few months anyway. I guess everyone's looking for a furry companion.""
B: ""I don't know where I'd be without my furry companions. They were keeping me company this afternoon while I worked on learning a new song. I think you'll like it: ""Satisfaction"" by the Stones!""
A: ""That's a great song! And yeah, my kids and my cats keep me company. We've got a full, lively house!""
B: ""Are you thinking on adding on, now that you have another one on the way?""
A: ""Probably not. I think we're done. We've got plenty of humans and animals in our home. By the way, tell me more about your cats. What are their names?""
B: ""I meant adding on a room to your house (I'm interested in those kind of things!). My darlings are Lubov (the Russian blue), Aiko (the Japanese bobtail) and Maiah (the birman). All three names mean beloved in the language of the place of origin of the cat's breed.""
A: ""Ah, gotcha. Hmm, we haven't really considered that, though I'd be open to the idea. Any pointers? Also, those are wonderful names!""
B: ""Well, adding a room onto your house could be a big project depending on the style of your house. I'd be happy to advise if you want. Have you thought about baby names yet?""
A: ""Maybe we can set up a call to talk about expanding our house! You could even be our contractor! And not yet--I'll need to ask my husband. Maybe my sons also have some good ideas!""
B: ""I bet your boys could have some really creative baby names to suggest. If you decide you want to move forward, either I can help or I can refer you to someone in your area.""

"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""Hey how are you doing?""
B: ""Tired man, been standing all day at the pumps. What about you?""
A: ""You work at a gas station? I had a long day of teaching""
B: ""New job, I do not think it will work. You teach kids?""
A: ""That does now sound fun. Yeah elementary students""
B: ""The fumes get to me, would rather be in the gardens. Hungry?""
A: ""Do you have a garden. Yeah I could eat""
B: ""Those carrots are from my garden, I could try landscaping maybe.""
A: ""Do you think you would like that, I take landscape photography""
B: ""I love working with my hands but they just want people to cut grass.""
A: ""Oh my, can you speak any other languages?""
B: ""Nope, do you? I wonder if my real parents spoke english.""
A: ""Are you adopted? I wonder""
B: ""Yeah, the people who adopted me are a hoot though. Trying to marry me off.""
A: ""Haha oh yeah are you a woman?""
B: ""Nope but my dad wants to find me a good one to date.""
A: ""Has the new job gotten any better?""
B: ""I'm not really sure how I feel about it! It is new, you know? How's teaching going? Do you have any favorite students?""
A: ""It's going well. We're still early in the school year so it's hard to say. I'm sure eventually a few will stand out. So what do you do at the gas station?""
B: ""I do a few things. Sometimes, I stock the shelves. Sometimes, I work the counter checking out customers.""
A: ""Do you work in one of the states where they still have you pump the gas? It's been a while since I've seen a full service gas station.""
B: ""No. They have to pump their own gas. They have to prepay first, though. Is there anything that you like about teaching the most?""
A: ""It's always fun to see their minds really churn on a new idea or concept. Also, when one of them is really into the material.""
B: ""Is it like watching their eyes light up when they see candy? Haha. Would you change jobs if you had the chance?""
A: ""Ha, no. Not quite that gleeful. Um... I'm not sure. I suppose it would depend on the position that I was presented with. I really enjoy teaching and if the new job involved teaching and paid well I might consider it. Are you working at the gas station long term or is it just a temporary job?""
B: ""I think I'm just going to be here temporarily, but who am I to say? I can't predict the future. Haha. I'm hoping to work here until I save up enough money to have enough downtime and find a better job. What if it was college wanting to hire you?""
A: ""I'd definitely be interested. I hear that unless you're in a tenured position though it can be really tough to make a living as a professor. A lot of work going to adjuncts that are only working part time.""
B: ""I didn't know that. I suppose you would have to have another job on the side if it were that way? Are there any other occupations you would consider aside from teaching if it came down to it?""
A: ""How is your vegetable garden coming along?""
B: ""Oh good, things are popping up now as the weather warms up, I've been waiting to see green!""
A: ""Do you only grow carrots or do you grow other vegetables as well?""
B: ""My favorite is carrots, but I grow alot. Tomatoes, peppers, squashes, peas, beans, etc.""
A: ""I am not a gardener but I am growing some peppers myself. I love eating peppers so I wanted to grow my own""
B: ""Oh thats very cool, good idea too, you can save a good amount of money growing your own. Do you ever make sauasge and peppers?""
A: ""Yes I love sausage and peppers. I grew up eating it all the time""
B: ""Nice, me as well. Are you Italian. I am not, just something my mom liked to make.""
A: ""No I am Irish but my parents grew up in an Italian neighborhood in NYC so we eat a lot of Italian food""
B: ""Right, makes sense I grew up in a NYC suburb so it was common food around us.""
A: ""Many people think they are Italian because of their thick accents""
B: ""I have an accent too. Do you live in that area now?""
A: ""What part of NYC are you from?""
B: ""out near Manhattan still close to the city though""
A: ""I'm very close to you. I live in Fort Lee, New Jersey, which is right outside Manhattan. It's a quick drive over the George Washington Bridge from my house.""
B: ""NIce!  Ive only ever been to Paramus.  I dont go to Jersey much""
A: ""Paramus has a couple of great malls. There is the Westfield Garden State Plaza and the Paramus Park Mall. Did you got there when you went to Paramus?""
B: ""I dont remember what mall it was I just remember it had a burger place that was owned by Bobby Flay.  Best burger ive ever had""
A: ""Bobby Flay is a great chef and cool guy. Plus, he's Irish like me! I know he has a couple of Michelin-star restaurants in NYC.""
B: ""It was called Bobbys Burger Palace.  I got a burger with a fried egg and bacon and their special sauce.  The onlky other time I had a TV chef meal was at Guy Feries in Vegas it was a mac and cheese burger""
A: ""Both of those sound yummy! It must be tough to afford eating out with your low-paying job at the gas station.""
B: ""Bobbys Burgers werent too bad, and I was in vegas for a bachelor party that everything was covered I could never afford a trip like that with gas money.""
A: ""I know what it's like to work in low-paying, retail and customer service jobs. How are you doing with saving money?""
B: ""I put away what I can and try not to touch it, but sometimes its hard""

A: ""I'm very good. When I recently got fired I got a new job. Thank goodness!""

A: ""My cousin always tries to get me into those sports games, but I feel like I'm much better in real life lol. And they don't really do softball games, do they? Are there any sports games you'd recommend? I really wanted to go with dyeing it purple or something, but I have to keep it natural colors for the Army. ""
B: ""You're right because I don't know any softball video games! I know Madden and FIFA are super popular though. Purple would be fun but I get the army would not allow crazy fun colors! Maybe you could use temporary hair dye in the future!""
A: ""They are always playing FIFA at my family parties lol. I could definitely try temporary. Are you free to do your hair however in the factory?""
B: ""My managers could care less as long as I show up to work! I think it would matter more if I was in a leadership role or had to deal with customers and clients. I've tried temporary hair color because it's so easy to just wash out but you still can experiment with your look""
A: ""That sounds really fun! I would love to be in an environment like that. But working from home would definitely be best lol.""
B: ""It's hard to beat the comfort of being at home and saving time without commuting. Do you like the army so far?""

A: ""Do it! We only live once and rest is so important for our bodies. Our society has such a ""go go go"" mentality. I'm not sure. He has mentioned it a few times, but he has some other interests I could see him pursuing. ""
B: ""It would be cool to have all the men in the family in the army, but it's a tough job, so I understand if he does something else.

B: ""As long as it didn't conflict with work.  I could probably get my brother to join, too.  Would your cousin play?  I know he is always wanting to get you out on a sports field of some kind""
A: ""haha, oh yeah he would in a heartbeat! That sounds great. The more the merrier! What is your work schedule like?""
B: ""I always have Sunday off, but the other day varies.  I usually work 7-4, so as long as the games are in the evening or on Sunday it should be fine.  Have you decided if you are going to dye your hair yet?""
A: ""Ok! We'll see what everybodys schedules look like and go from there. I don't think so because the Army is so strict about it. I'd have to  dye it back soon so I think I'll wait.""

A: ""Next month!  Any chance you'll be on the panel?""
B: ""I'll have to check my calendar, but if I'm free then I'll definitely be there. Maybe we can meet up there while looking for r2d2.""
A: ""I will find him, someday.  I will!  I heard there is a new coffee shop down the street from there too.  We could swing by and get something to drink beforehand and you could add a review to your blog.""
B: ""That would be great! I'm always looking for more content for my blog. Especially when on mini vacations haha! What kind of coffee do you like?""
A: ""My favorite is from a local coffee shop - 'Cup-a-Joe'.  But I'm willing to try this new place to see if it compares.  I noticed they sell herbal tea too!""
B: ""You never know the quality of a new place until you try it. I hope they have peppermint tea, its my favorite.""
A: ""That sounds fantastic.  I meant to ask - how is your blog doing, anyhow?  Getting lots of traffic?""
A: ""If you spoke at the Star Wars convention, what topic would you like to speak on?""
B: ""I would totally talk about the difference between the older films and the newer ones.  The older ones are really timeless, that's why I like them so much better.""
A: ""That's interesting, I have yet to watch a single film from the series but I'll keep that in mind. How many conventions have you been to?""
B: ""I go pretty much every year, ever since I was a teenager.  It was fun to dress up back then, but I don't do it so much now.  Maybe when my boyfriend comes down for the next one we can dress up at Han and Leia though, that would be cool.""
A: ""That is very cool, I was thinking about going this year, hopefully I'll see you there! I was also looking to take a small trip somewhere soon, any recommendations?""
B: ""Are you planning on staying on the west coast, or are you going east?""
A: ""Definitely the west coast, I think I pretty much explored most of the places near the east coast.""
B: ""You could always go to Disneyland, haha.  Or you could go very north and do some hiking in Alaska.  I always wanted to do that.""
A: ""I am embarrassed to admit been to Disneyland one too many times, but I will keep Alaska in mind, hiking is definitely up my alley. Have you been? How was it?""
B: ""I've done some hiking in northern California, but I've never been to Alaska.  I really want to go sometime.  I like to go backpacking and take a tent up on the mountain.  It's nice to just drive a few hours north and get to experience the nature outside of the big city.""
A: ""That's amazing, I agree, I think I need to venture out more. I never thought I would be a outdoor person until recently so I'm trying my best to do as much as I can to see what I like. Thanks for the info though!""
B: ""Who are you planning on bringing with you?  I always make sure that I have one of my friends with me, some of my football friends like to go camping.  It's safer when you have other people with you in case you get hurt or stranded.""

A: ""I'm sorry to hear your arthritis is still acting up. Yes I still work out a lot. I find that if I put in the time each day I can enjoy my health and lifestyle more.""
B: ""That is great for you. I should really look into more exercises I can do for my hands. Any recommendations?""
A: ""Honestly just stretching and massaging would be best. My doctor recommends tart cherry juice for inflammation after I work out. It's great for the muscles.""
B: ""Oh, those are great ideas. I'll give those a try. Does it matter which cherry juice or any kind I can find at the store?""
A: ""Well I think that you can look some up and order it. A health food store might have it. Have you sold any new paintings lately?""
B: ""I'll look into that. I've got a few people interested, but the last one I sold was the one you bought. Have you picked up any others lately?""
A: ""No I haven't. Though I did go to a Picasso exhibit put on by locals that recreated a couple of his pieces. it was interesting!""

A: ""Greetings from Portland!  It was a beautiful sunny day :) The temperature was about 80 degrees which seems a little unusual.  Spring has certainly sprung.""
B: ""Has it? We're still seeing some winter here in the more rural areas. ""
A: ""No, I haven't skated yet.  Sorry to hear about your team tanking.  Wow, I hope the weather is more favorable for you especially for farming.  What types of things do you farm?""
B: ""Around here it's mostly potatoes and wheat. Our winters run much too long for most other crops to survive and thrive. ""
A: ""Yummy potatoes :) I went to a yard sale the other day with my brother.  A guy gave him a free DVD.  The movie was called Slap Shot.  My brother says it's really funny.  I can't wait to watch it. ""
B: ""I love potatoes, especially mashed. I've never heard of the Movie. I assume from the name it's about Hockey?""
A: ""Yes, indeed.  It's a comedy from 1977.  In our area, we have the Penguins hockey team.""
B: ""Oh, I'll have to watch it sometime. My favorite movies are comedies. Penguins are amazing, I can see why they'd choose that as their mascot. ""
A: ""Tee hee!  Yeah, they're great.  There was a movie about them too but I think it was a thriller.  I can't remember the name of it though.""
B: ""Paranormal Penguins maybe? I hear that's a movie about a hockey team trapped within a rink as terrifying mutated penguins rise from below the Ice. ""
A: ""How many acres of potatoes and wheat did you plant this year?""
B: ""120 acres of wheat and 200 acres of potatoes. Can never have enough potatoes!  ""
A: ""Haha I agree! I love potatoes too! There is this dish my family makes where you put potatoes, bacon, sausage, vegetables and spices and baked it in a dutch oven. Truly amazing! Is anybosy helping you with your farm?""
B: ""Iv got a few farm hands but mostly i do it myself, its easy this farming, you just put stuff in the ground at it grows!""
A: ""I didn't realize it is that easy... I definitely could not do it myself.  Have you seen the movie Slap Shot? Someone told me about it and I am wondering if it is any good?""
B: ""I have not seen that movie, but i just checked imdb and its only got 4.5/.10, i guess you should watch and judge for yourself. ""
A: ""Oh, thanks for checking that.  It is a movie about hockey.  I guess I will just watch it.  Our team is playing Las Vegas Silver Knights this weekend.""
B: ""Great, were playing the Canucks this coming Monday. Hopefully im done on the farm in time ti watch it. ""
A: ""Oh yeah, that should be a great game! I might watch it with my friends too.  We usually go to this brewery in town to watch games. What do you do?""
B: ""Usually i get my wife to hand cut some chips, make me a big bowl of poutine, i sit back in my armchair with a few cold beers and watch until i fall asleep. I dont think iv ever seen the end of a game iv watched at home!""
A: ""Hmmm I need to make notes for when I get married.  Hopefully my wife knows how to cook. How long have you been married?""
B: ""We've been together since i was 19, im 40 now, so 21 happy years. You should find yourself a nice wife and get in to farming, its so easy, you just put stuff in the ground and it grows,  there are harder jobs out there. ""
A: ""I decided to download the movie Slap Shot.  I'll let you know how it is.""
B: ""Yes, please do! I've been wanting to see it! When do you plan on watching it?""
A: ""I am downloading it now.  I hope to watch it this evening.  Any movies you would recommend while I am looking for other things to watch?""
B: ""Well since you like hockey, you might like watching the Mighty Ducks movies, if you haven't already seen them. I love those movies! Have you seen them?""
A: ""No.  I will add them to my list!  Do you get much time to watch movies since you have to take care of the farm?""
B: ""Yea, weekends are my free time to relax a little bit with my wife, so we'll watch a movie or two during our time. We need to have you over some time so we can give you some more info about farming, would you like that?""
A: ""Sure.   What do you farm?  And, do you have any animals?  I have never had any pets growing up so I love when I get a chance to play with any animals.""
B: ""I raise and breed livestock such as cattle, sheep and horses. My dog Remo helps me get the animals in order, drives me insane sometimes. When you come over to check out the farm I'll introduce you to the animals. Have you ever thought about getting a pet?""
A: ""Sometimes.  But, I really like to be able to come and go without having to worry about a pet.  I spend most of my time working on my skating and it would be unfair to a pet to leave it alone as much as I am out.""
B: ""That makes sense, and very smart. Pets need a lot of attention and don't allow you much time to relax. Speaking of which, tell me more about this relax sleep you've been learning. I'm really interested in this, how is that going?""
A: ""It is interesting.  I am trying to so I feel more refreshed when I wake up.  I have only been at it a few days.  They say I need to give it about a week before I will notice anything different.  I will keep you updated though!""

B: ""Oh.  Those are good ones!  Are they the ones you teach your students too?""
A: ""Yes, those and many other great books. They are very receptive to those books as well. ""

B: ""I had to stop comparing the movies and the books. It started making me feel like a critic to always be pointing out what they missed LOL.

B: ""That is exactly why I like it. It's not too spicy. Did you try anything else?""
A: ""I had it with naan bread. That was good too. Would you recommend anything lese?""

B: ""No, not at all! I will make sure to make an extra plate for her. Where is she coming into town from?""
A: ""She lives in Chicago. She's coming into town for business but I would love for her to have some fun while she's here too. She's 5 years older than I. ""
B: ""That is so exciting! How long is she going to be in town? How long has it been since you have last seen each other?""
A: ""She's going to be in town for three weeks. I haven't seen her in almost five years. Do you have any siblings? ""
B: ""Wow, five years is a long time! I have two younger sisters and I see them fairly often. They live nearby and we do family dinners every once in a while. What kinds of things do you want to show her while she is in town?""
A: ""Oh that's great! I have three older brothers, also. We're all spread out throughout the country so we don't get to see each other often but when we do it's great. I'd love to show her some of the museums in town. Or maybe catch a show! Do you have any suggestions? ry. ""
B: ""My suggestion would have been one of the museums. I hear there is a great new art exhibit. That could be a lot of fun to bring her to. What kinds of shows would she be interested in? I can ask around to see if anyone I know has any that they particularly enjoyed.""
A: ""Would you like to join us at the art exhibit? I think any kind of show would be fine...She enjoys doing most anything! It would be a lot of fun if you were to join us. ""
B: ""Thanks so much for the invite. I would love to come, but I don't want to intrude on any family time. Maybe I could bring my sisters and we can make it a whole family event?""
A: ""That would be so much fun! Maybe we could go to a spa too? Make it a real sisters day! ""
B: ""That would be quite a day. I haven't been to a spa in forever. When was the last time you went to one? Is there one nearby you know of?""
A: ""I spoke with my sister yesterday. She definitely wants to check out the museum!""
B: ""Sounds like a plan to me! Maybe we can hit up the spa afterwards for facials.""
A: ""That sounds so awesome!  The spa is just a block or two away from the museum right?""
B: ""Yes, it's super close by. They have a fantastic pool area too.""
A: ""I'm pretty excited.  It just dawned on me that just a couple more blocks away is Curry in a Hurry.  We can visit the museum, get a facial, and then enjoy some Indian food!  The walking we do will offset the meal.""
B: ""Well this sounds like it's turning into quite the awesome day.  I hope they have chicken tikka masala, it's my favorite.""
A: ""I am certain they do.  They also have a ""Walk on the Mild Side"" menu that is less spicy, which is perfect for me.  ""
B: ""Oh good, I like things that aren't too spicy. Even after growing up in India I've never gotten used to things that are too spicy.""
A: ""Do you ever miss India or does your mom always keep a little bit of India at home to keep it fresh in your mind?""
B: ""My mom tries to stay very traditional. We eat a lot of Indian food.""
A: ""That is really cool!  I sometimes wonder how I will be as a mother.  My husband says I will be great and have the perfect temperament, but it's just so scary for me to think about.""
B: ""I think as long as your heart is in it, you'll do great.""

B: ""I have never been there. It is on my bucket list!""
A: ""So did you find any more crazy sports on youtube?""
B: ""Oh, no. I love spending hours on youtube, but the only sport I watch is cricket. What sport do you recommend to people who aren't usually into it?""
A: ""Thank you for asking. My favorite sport is running. I like doing it, and watching it sometimes too. I learn a lot watching pro runners. Wonder if Atlantic City has any good 5k or 10k runs. I travel for those sometimes. ""
B: ""Oh, wow. I think I stray from such things because of my weight. I find it uncomfortable watching such fit people perform olympic feats like that. Cricket is much easier to swallow. Though, I might be interested in watching one of those just to visit Atlantic City.""
A: ""I hear you on body image stuff, and sometimes I have perception issues. It's good to check with a friend, partner. The best runs are through the forest, although maybe I'd consider a busy place like Atlantic City. With the right company! ""
B: ""Aww, thanks for understanding. And yeah, that'd be a great time. Though, a walk through a forest might be nice. I think the exploratory nature of it would make it a better motivator. Though I much prefer vegetables, maybe you could teach me some dieting tips as well. I'm sure your version of ""vegetarian"" is better for the body.""
A: ""I find that if I am patient and allow mistakes sometimes, it helps me keep on track better. Allowing mistakes within a range, yeah, perfectionism can take over sometimes. Although not for the reasons people think. Simple food is good. Love chia seeds!""
B: ""That's really good advice! When I used to diet, messing up a streak would really kill me inside. And that would make me relapse into really unhealthy foods. I think allowing myself room for error is a good idea. And yeah, I think simple might be good. Can chia seeds and such really fill you up, though?""
A: ""I have been eating them for many years. Omega 3 nutrients, which you find in fish oil too, but this is a natural source. Also, the best benefit is fiber. They fill you up. 1 teaspoon needs 4 ounces water to soak them, because they get big. You soak them first. Eat them daily here! Do you have a fave? ""
B: ""Oh, really? I do take Omega 3 vitamins, when I remember! So, that does sound good. Oh, I didn't know that they expand! That seems much more sensible than little seeds. Well, I mostly eat lots of potatoes. Which, I know isn't the healthiest, but it does leave me satisfied. Maybe I can taper down, and slowly work down my portions with other foods like that. I do enjoy cashews and nuts and such a lot too. I know they're fatty, but of a healthier variety.""
A: ""Cashews are a fave! And I can eat too much mashed potatoes, if they have a big helping at a dinner. Butter too. ""
B: ""Hahaha, you don't have to tell me! I'm thinking I may try to work in more shakes. Perhaps soy and oats, with some sort of supplement powder. Is that a good way of getting in nutrients without too much calories?""
A: ""I saw a sign up sheet at my local grocery store for a 5k run. I think I'm going to sign up for it!""
B: ""Oh really? That's so exciting! Are you ready for it?? Do you have any training before the run?""
A: ""I don't feel ready for it! The most I've ever run is 2k and I found that challenging enough. I'm planning on steadily increasing how much I run so I build up my endurance - hopefully I can get to a point where I can run 5k easily!""
B: ""That's a very smart idea! I hear that it's relatively easy to build stamina through regular cardio vascular exercise. Do you like to swim too?""
A: ""I never really learnt to swim, I tend to just splash around in the water. Are you good at swimming?""
B: ""No, but I am seriously considering picking it up since I haven't swam seriously since I was little. It is hard to find motivation some times though.""
A: ""Yeah I feel that. I try to eat super healthy (chia seeds and lots of antioxidants) so I don't have too many calories to burn off. Do you eat healthily?""

A: ""Algebra is pretty simple to understand if it's taught to you correctly. It gets confusing when they start mixing the letters with the numbers. I'm sure you do just fine with trying to teach her.

A: ""I'm fine, and so is the dog.  I thought of you actually.  The dog jumped so quick and was so fast, I think he could compete in agility competitions if he was better trained!  Have you been doing well in your competitions?""
B: ""Awww, I am glad both you and the dog are fine. Yes, we won first place last week! ""
A: ""That's so cool!  Was the competition local or did you have to travel?  ""
B: ""It was local this time. We have a competition coming up next month that is in Florida. I can't wait. I am making it a vacation and we are staying for a whole week. ""
A: ""I'm so jealous!  Ever since I moved out of my parent's place I haven't had enough money scraped up to travel.  But even though I don't live there, I still get to hear about how I should be married already almost daily.""
B: ""Oh geesh. I am so sorry about that. Hey, wanna go with me next month to the competition? I'll pay for everything! ""
A: ""That's so nice of you to offer!  I can't get much time off work right now though, the restaurant has been slammed.  Are they hiring at your bookstore by any chance?""
A: ""I have to get the brakes on my new car repaired after the accident. Any news about the bookstore?""
B: ""Some new books just arrived that I'm eager to check into. What happened with the accident?""
A: ""I got rear-ended leaving a parking lot the other day. It wasn't a bad accident and there was no obvious damage, but unfortunately my brakes have been a little out of whack ever since. I'm so annoyed but it could have been much worse. I just figured I would let you know, but we don't need to get too much into it! Do you usually end up buying a lot of books from the store you work at? What kinds of new ones are you excited about?""
B: ""I am glad you are ok. Get those brakes fixed ASAP. I don't get to buy books for the bookstore but I get to read and review them. I love a good thriller book. How's your job at the restaurant going?""
A: ""That's actually a pretty good perk! Do you read them so you can share your recommendations with customers? The restaurant has been somewhat slow this week, but I expect things to pick up over the weekend since we have a lot of good reservations already!""
B: ""I know right!? That's the main reason I took the job. I love telling people what books are engaging or informative or even boring. I have a little section for my books of the week. Well, I would expect to be busy over the weekend for sure if people are already booking reservations. Hopefully you're not slammed out of control. ""
A: ""Being totally slammed isn't the worst thing in the world! I like to keep busy and to make good tips, but it can be exhausting for sure. How long have you been working at your current job? Is it something you see yourself doing long term?""
B: ""Well I recently just stumbled upon it. After college and my parents kicking me out I needed to find work. What a better job than turning your hobby and love of reading into a paycheck. I get the idea of being slammed being a good thing. I love it when the store has something going on and we are just slammed with people. I hope I can open my own bookstore one day. I found my passion. What about you and the restaurant? Do you want to be there long-term?""
A: ""What did you study while you were in college?""
B: ""Well, mostly Chemistry with a minor in inter-personal media communications. What about you?""
A: ""I haven't gone to college yet, I have found myself successful working at restaurants. Did you participate in competitive sports at college?""
B: ""Yes, I played short stop for my colleges baseball team! Though, I really wanted to join the chess club.""
A: ""Awesome! I always have a good time playing chess, I recently started playing it during my off time and have been having a blast. We should play chess together sometime. How is your dog doing?""
B: ""Ol' Baba Yaga is doing just fine! He's so small I emptied out the bottom bookshelf in my room and he just sleeps there haha!""
A: ""Oh my god, that is so cute! I'm thinking about getting a dog myself, how much effort does it take to take care of Ol' Baba Yaga?""
B: ""He's a very high maintenance boy but that's just his personality and breed. Most dogs are pretty relaxed once they get through their puppy phase as long as they're trained right.""
A: ""Thanks for the advice, ill make sure to train my puppy right away if I do end up getting one soon. Have you had any canine competitions that you've attended recently?""
B: ""Not very recently we've just been taking it easy ol' Baba Yaga and I.""
A: ""Yeah, sometimes you need to take some time to rest and reset to comeback better in future competitions. Have you read any new books recently?""

B: ""My parents had a yacht when I was little and I would go with them, so I guess I'm just used to the lifestyle.  How are your roses doing?  What kind do you grow?""
A: ""That sounds really fun. They are doing well, but I am worried we will have a late Spring freeze and hurt them a little. I like to stick to the traditional red ones, they are my favorite, but I recently got some pink ones, that are smaller. Have you been to any good restaurants lately?""
B: ""Oh no hopefully they can hold out for you and the freeze didn't ruin them!  There was this little family restaurant I just went to in the Dominican.  They had the best sandwiches and a bunch of tea too.  I'm sure you would like it there.""
A: ""That sounds really good! I may have to stick to local, though. How has your AirBnB been going? Are you worried about your yacht when you rent it out?""
B: ""It has been going well.  It pretty much pays for all my trips I take when I'm not renting it out.  Yes, I do get worried sometimes, but that's why I have a good insurance policy for that.""
A: ""That is the best way to do it. Have someone else paying for your trips. I should look into that, but with my house. I think I could make some money, since I am by the ski resorts.""

A: ""I have not traveled due to my anxiety. Do you have any advice on overcoming this?""
B: ""Maybe you could try small trips first and eventually work up to traveling far from home. How far is the city from your home? You could take a few trips there and see if it's too stressful for you.""
A: ""It is not too far from my house. maybe you can come visit with your family and help tend to the garden. ""

A: ""My garden is dying. I have to start over""
B: ""sometimes a new start is a good thing, what are you going to plant this time?  I have to get the yacht ready for the weekend more guests  ""

A: ""Ah that makes sense! I don't think I could stay on a yacht, I'm terrified of the ocean. Do you like the sea?""
B: ""I do I love it very much, there's nothing better than a wind powered yacht cruising the high seas. You become very in-tune with nature that way. That sucks that one of your fears is the ocean but it's good to have some fear for it. WHat kind of museum do you work at? ""
A: ""I work at a natural history museum. I arrange displays and come up with new exhibit ideas which is very fulfilling, but it's hard work! Do you go to museums often?""

A: ""I love hearing about other museums, but I absolutely hate travelling so I've only been to the one I work at!""
B: ""That's the bonus to working in a museum though right, the exhibits change or some travel around the world from museum to museum. The best part of travelling is getting to see other cultures, foods , art etc  I will agree the rest is just stressful ""
A: ""That's true. Though it's only a small museum and we don't have a massive budget to get new exhibits in all the time unfortunately. I think I like the idea of travelling, but because I'm a bit deaf I just feel stressed whenever I have to travel anywhere!""

B: ""What position do you play?""
A: ""I stopped in about that server job.""
B: ""Oh really? How did that go?""
A: ""I think the interview went well.  I mentioned my love of garlic bread, which seemed to help.  The owner also had a daughter who was in gymnastics with my sister back in the day, so hopefully that all helps.""
B: ""Haha! That's funny. Great job. And believe me, there's plenty of leftover garlic bread so they'll appreciate it not going to waste!""
A: ""Good thing that we both keep active since we eat so many carbs.  How's the new cardio regimen been working for you?""
B: ""It's been going well thanks! Feels good to get into a rhythm with it. How's basketball been going?""
A: ""I tweaked my hamstring the other day in a pickup game with some guys down at the gym.  And of course we were playing the team full of mouthy Yankees fans.  I'm so glad you don't root for them!  How is your team doing in the standings?""
B: ""That sucks, I'm so sorry! I hope you feel better soon. We've definitely had better years but as long as we're not at the very bottom I'll take it, haha!""
A: ""I hear ya.  You should try being from Chicago and a Cubs fan...bottom of the heap every year, World Series champs, then back to the bottom of the division.  I swear if sports were a country song, Cubs fans would lose their job, their girl, their dog, and their truck.""
B: ""Hahaha oh ain't that the truth! Living life the hard way, that's for sure. Builds character and all that, I guess. Or at least makes the winning all the sweeter when it finally happens.""
A: ""That's very true.  No matter what sport you play or team you cheer for, that's the lesson you learn.  I learned that early in life playing basketball, baseball and soccer.""
B: ""I definitely wish I'd done more sports as a kid. Team sports are so much more than just playing with other people. You learn so much about others and yourself.""
A: ""My hamstring is really starting to bother me.""
B: ""While working out I have hurt my hamstring too. Have you been using ice?""
A: ""Yes but the ice doesn't seem to be helping too much. Do you have any other types of favorite food?""
B: ""I really love pasta. Especially chicken alfredo. ""
A: ""I like a good chicken alfredo too. Extra cheesy is the best. Do you have any suggestions on good stretches to avoid injuring your hamstring?""
B: ""I think lunges will help you! ""
A: ""When my hamstring is feeling better I will have to incorporate lunges into my routine. ""
B: ""I think that is a great idea! You can even try it now and it will probably help. ""
A: ""I think when I can move better I will do a couple of lunges. Do you like mushrooms they are really great sauteed in a bowl of homemade pasta. ""
A: ""I am going to see a basketball game this weekend. Then, I am going to try this new Italian restaurant with my sister. ""
B: ""Oh that sounds like a great time! What do you think you'll order?""
A: ""Ooh, I'm hoping they'll have some Gnocchi for me to try. It's really hard to find a good Gnocchi around me.""
B: ""My mouth is watering already! Hey, I hope you don't mind if I ask the waiter to pull up a seat. I am dying for some Italian food.""
A: ""Of course come on through, maybe they'll have a slice of Tiramisu or two.""
B: ""Haha ever the poet. I might have to follow your lead and go for a run or something. Italian carbs are sooo good but they won't burn themselves off.""
A: ""True that! I will join you for that run any day. How do you feel about a good swim though?""
B: ""It's super tiring but I love the feeling of a full body workout that I get from it. Oh! We might have to wait a bit before we hop in the pool if we end up with leftovers. Italian food does not last long in my house.""
A: ""Gotta hide it. Italian left overs may be the most sought after left overs. Probably the gold of the left overs world.""
B: ""So true. It's a good thing that I don't have it all the time! Otherwise I'd be broke and fat.""
A: ""I am considering taking a course in Italian cuisine so I make a mean chicken parmesan.""
B: ""That sounds well worth whatever it takes to burn it off. I'd love to grab a bite next once you master the chicken parm.""

B: ""They're filming cliffhanger 2 and I was there briefly as a double.""

A: ""I up and quit my jobs. I am pursuing my spirituality full time. Alaska rocks!""
B: ""Yes, it does. Feed your body and mind well and you'll be strong!""
A: ""Yes! I studied buddhism first before I practicing. I meditate daily.""
B: ""I read a lot on meditation and religions. What will you study next?""
A: ""Right now I should be learning how to survive winters here. Not used to cold.""
B: ""The food there's not as kosher as I would like it. Try working out.""

B: ""Hopefully it will warm up soon. I have seen beautiful pictures of Alaska in the summer.  So many wildflowers!  I imagine there are some fabulous trails to hike.  What do you do for your daily workouts?""
A: ""Yes. I look forward to Summer. I do high intensity interval training for my daily workouts and a bit of yoga""
B: ""I like HIIT training.  I feel like I accomplish a lot in a relatively short amount of time. I hope you'll soon be able to move your yoga outside onto a deck. Seems like that would be zen.""
A: ""I can't wait .I do need more activities to help me fill my time. Maybe i could learn more about other religions""
B: ""That would be very interesting!  I would bet it is fairly easy to find online comparative religion courses from various universities or even community colleges.""
A: ""Yes, I'm sure there a many sources. The research itself should keep me busy. Do you recommend any religions? ""
B: ""I have friends of all different religions and there are parts of each that resonate with me and other parts that leave me thinking ""um, what?"" ha ha  For me I find a general peaceful and accepting nature to be the way to live.  It allows me to be receptive to different ideas. Were you raised in a particular faith?""
A: ""Yes .I was raised Catholic but I'd love to continue my spiritual journey but learning about many more religions.""
B: ""I was raised Christian and it is difficult for my family to see me exploring other faiths.  They don't understand why I am curious and feel I am turning on them by asking questions.""
A: ""The weather up here is finally warming up, I did my yoga on the porch this morning.""
B: ""That's awesome! Nothing beats doing yoga outdoors! What is your favorite time of day to do yoga? ""
A: ""My favorite time is the morning it helps me focus and stretches my body to get me ready for the day. What is HIIT training?""
B: ""My favorite time of day to exercise is in the morning also. I call it 30 before 7:30 because I try to get in at least 30 minutes of HIIT before then. HIIT is High Intensity Interval Training. It is short bursts of working out as hard as you can, followed by short periods of resting. Alternating the two back and forth. It'll wake you up first thing in the morning for sure! Have you ever tried anything like that? ""
A: ""Yes I have. It is a pretty effective work. I was wondering what was your day job? ""
B: ""I'm an EMT during the day. It's tough work but definitely rewarding. And requires the fitness. What about yourself?""
A: ""I am not working at the moment. I am focusing on my spirituality full time. Being here in Alaska closer to nature awakens feelings and desires to be closer to nature and the beyond. Have you ever had a spiritual awakening?""
B: ""Wow that is amazing! I did actually, almost a year ago I was introduced to Abraham Hicks, and I've worked with a few spiritual coaches since then. I'm always studying the law of attraction. Do you have any books or spiritual guides you'd recommend me looking into? ""
A: ""The power of now, The spiritual guide which disentangles the soul and the book of joy are pretty good reads""
B: ""That's great! Have you read The Secret?""
A: ""No I have heard of it. Is it a good read?""
B: ""It is! It's what many of the spiritual leaders base their teachings upon. It's kind of the holy grail of spirituality. ""
A: ""Tell me more about your spiritual awakening.""
B: ""Well, it had a lot to do with the location and the accoutrements of the event. A very strange experience indeed.""
A: ""Where did this experience happen? Does the environment make much difference? ""
B: ""At the time I was in the hills outside a small village in Peru. I payed for a 'Shaman' to take me into the hills so that I could have the experience that I was looking for. I would say the location matters a lot. You always want to be in a safe location during your spiritual awakening.""
A: ""I agree. I am very spitirual but I think my journey has been more gradual than an awakening experience. I feel more grounded and centered with every day that practice. ""
B: ""I agree with that sentiment. All things in moderation right. Do you find that yoga helps you to feel more spiritual ,or in a sense, 'closer to god'?""
A: ""I don't believe in a god per say, but I do feel much closer to the earth and myself during yoga.""
B: ""Oh I bet, especially in Alaska I'm sure that feeling must be amazing!""
A: ""During the light hours of the year it's wonderful, but we have months of darkness where I live and it can difficult to maintain that sense of spirituality. ""
B: ""I'm sure! It must get pretty sleepy over there. Months of hibernation huh.""
A: ""haha yea. That's one of the reasons I had to quit my job because it was very difficult to keep my sleep schedule on track when there is no daylight. I'm sure you could handle it though, you seem tough. ""

A: ""That is a great idea. I will look for a costume pattern with that in mind. You should get back into sewing, it may help manage the stress of looking for a school! Any front runners on the school search?""
B: ""No not yet. I keep looking at schools up north when I really need to be looking at school down south where it is warm! I think I might do some sort of embroidery project since I do not have the time to dedicate to a full pattern.  ""
A: ""Going to school in the warm weather sounds like a good call if you ask me! I sure enjoy embroidery as well. I love the attention to detail that is needed. Sure helps me relax. ""
B: ""It's true! Does your sewing machine have any new features? ""
A: ""Yes it does, and honestly I have some learning to do! I need to read the manual so I can use it to its full potential. I can even hook it up to the computer to download embroidery patterns. ""
B: ""Oh wow! I can't believe all the things that are possible today! It would be really interesting to embroider the same pattern as the machine and see how much faster the machine is! ""

B: ""That's an excellent suggestion. I will have to explore more of the stitching world sometime. There's something inherently relaxing about losing yourself in the patterns. Though I'm sure you know that full well.""

A: ""What? That'sn't very good, you know!""
B: ""I'm afraid of clowns so the jaws of lions can save me""
A: ""I do not like lions very much. They kill people.""
B: ""Then I can shake hands with them, and thank them for the service""
A: ""Why are you afraid of clowns""
B: ""I am not sure! It is really pretty irrational. Do you have any fears?""
A: ""Cockroaches and silverfish. And apathy. And Republicans.""
B: ""Oh I like bugs! The other two I agree. What if you met a really empathetic silverfish? ""
A: ""Won't happen. Silverfish are evil. Evil beings don't have any empathy. I do like other bugs. Spiders are cool.""
B: ""Ha ha fair fair! I always find really big wolf spiders here at the station! I always trap them in a cup and let them free outside. ""
A: ""Do they thank you for giving them their freedom?""
B: ""No not yet.... but maybe one day I will be thanking them for giving me my freedom.""
A: ""How would the wolf spiders you release give you your freedom? I don't understand.""
B: ""Maybe one day I will be trapped somewhere and they will free me because I was kind to them in the past. ""
A: ""That makes sense. What is your favorite movie of all time?""
B: ""I think it would have to be Fargo. What about you?""
A: ""I have thought about what you said about the spiders maybe saving you some day and I have captured and released my first spider.""
B: ""That's good, I'm proud of you, you never know what each member of the ecosystem can do for us.""
A: ""I don't know much about that. What are some of the benefits of spiders to the ecosystem?""
B: ""They eat a lot of insects that could impact farming, they eat the type of bugs that would get on budding plants and the like.""
A: ""That's a great benefit. I would hope spiders kill cockroaches and silverfish too!  How has work been going at the station?""
B: ""It's been going okay, I had this one guy who came up, asked for a full tank and then left to go into the store. He was gone for nearly 10 minutes even after I finished pumping his gas.""
A: ""Should feed him to the spiders when he gets back! Or maybe the Lions if you go back to the circus. ""
B: ""Ha, Ha! That's a good idea. Let the clowns and the lions deal with him. Maybe he'll be as freaked about them as I am. Have you heard from your aunt? Is she well?""
A: ""I saw her last week. We never lost contact after she helped me escape. Thanks for asking. I am lucky to have her. Especially when there are bugs around because she gets rid of them for me. ""
B: ""That's good. I love it when, in the early days of spring, I start finding ladybugs around my house. Its a good sign of the changing of the seasons. It'll be voting season soon.""
A: ""I learned those aren't actually lady bugs. They're beetles, an infestation. Just like... silverfish. Ew. I cannot vote so I don't know much about voting season.""

B: ""I do!  I love the beautiful patterns on their shells.  From what I have heard, they do bite but I have not had one bite me.  I think that would be better than a lion bite though!  LOL.  I see you also do not like lions.  What is your favorite animal?""
A: ""I like small cute animals like cats or little dogs. I don't have any pets right now but I would love adopt one day. ""
B: ""I have a dog.  She is great!  My parents really like her.  I know you did not get along that well with your parents growing up, but do you stay in touch with them at all?""
A: ""No, they were abusive and cruel and I have no desire to contact them. I think it's wonderful that your parents adopted you and that you're close with them.""

B: ""Work is okay. I am taking a vacation soon though. Does your work give you time off for vacation?""

A: ""I usually leave my dogs when going for vacation, it's too much work travelling with them. Do yo uusally take yours with you?""
B: ""Barnby loves car rides so we take him everywhere. I get it since you have two and portugese water dogs are quite sizable. Maybe you can rent a larger SUV""
A: ""I've spoken to the golf club and they will show the race on the big screen. My tournament starts at 6.30pm. Do you want to come?""
B: ""I believe I'm open for that date so absolutely.  Are you sure it won't mess with your plans?  I don't suppose the club allows pets?""
A: ""Absolutely not, if you're interested in seeing what the game is like, it will give you a chance front and center. I wish I could take my dogs everywhere but no they don't allow pets. I probably will just get a friend to look after them. Sometimes I wish I had a mate to share my life with. What is married life like?""
B: ""I love it.  My wife is my world.  She has been there for me in everything.  Just keep your heads up.  The right person will come along.  Hopefully they will love dogs also!""
A: ""Aww that warms my heart. I want that. Sometimes I think that people worry about age and think it's too late but you're right, it happens when you least expect it. I'll try to remember that. Do you and your wife have children together? ""
B: ""Yes!   We have 3 children.  It works out great because they love Barnby and look out for him.  It has its ups and downs, but there is love always.  How much time do you have to socialize?  I know banking can be stressful.  Add taking care of two pets and you have a full schedule.""
A: ""Sound like you have your hands full.  I usually use my weekends to socialize, going out with friends or planig short trips. I just took off for vacation actually and went to the grand canyon. I had always wanted to see it. ""
B: ""I have been there and it is beautiful.  I love going to places that take my breath away.  I hope that Daytona will do that for me when I get there.  I plan on touring the track when I get there.""
A: ""It was very breath taking. Will you be taking your family with you? ""
B: ""Yes I will.  We will leave Barnby with my sister till we get back.  My family and I will meet our tour guide there the day after we arrive and will get a full tour of Daytona Speedway.  I am excited.""
A: ""I think you're goig to love it. I've been and it took about 4 hours to finish the tour. Are you a racing fan? ""
B: ""Oh yes.  I have been to Talladega several times.  But this will be my first trip to Daytona.  I am ready and willing!!!!""

B: ""Barnby is doing great. We just went for our evening walk. What are your dogs names again?""
A: ""Rambo and Woofer. Poetry isn't it! hehe. It's fun to name your dogs something a little silly, makes me smile. ""
B: ""I can only hope that the Frenchie is the one named Rambo! I think it's great. ""
A: ""Just looking at that dogs makes me laugh, I mean, frenchies are a sight to behold, their features! I love them. ""
B: ""I bet! One used to go with its owner to the bar I liked in college. It would always sit at the bar in a stool. ""
A: ""They can be pretty domesticated, almost regal sometimes. And then they get zoomies, run around the room like tornados!""
B: ""Did you take them on your trip to the Grand Canyon?""
A: ""Usually a kennel is what I prefer, so there's just less mechanical stuff to manage on trips. You like travelling with yours? ""

B: ""I listen to music while working out!""
A: ""What kind of music do you like the most?""
B: ""I love punk rock music. What about you?""
A: ""I'm more of a classical person. I play a ton of instruments""
B: ""What type of instruments do you play?""
A: ""I play violin, like my father. I also play piano, guitar, bass, drums""
B: ""Awesome! I do not really play instruments but that would be neat to learn!""
A: ""I teach piano actually, on the side""
B: ""Oh cool! Do you have many students?""
A: ""My father is giving me one of his old violins, it's probably worth a fortune.""
B: ""That's really cool! I've always wanted to learn an instrument, is the violin an easy one to learn?""
A: ""It was not easy for me.  I am a product of extensive practice and training I feel.  Some people have a great deal of natural talent though.""
B: ""I have a very disciplined personality which I usually apply to working out.  Hopefully that will help me when I try to learn an instrument.""
A: ""I think it will.  You also need to find a reputable teacher though.  Try to avoid people who describe themselves as ""self-taught"".  I would prioritize finding a teacher with respectable training.""
B: ""That's great advice.  Which instrument do you think is the best for a beginner to learn?""
A: ""I would recommend learning the piano first.  I would start with a keyboard before an actual piano though, as the cost and size of a real piano are quite a commitment.""
B: ""I really love punk rock.  Have you ever tried to play that style of music?""
A: ""I mainly focus on classical music.  I am open to trying punk rock though, I would love to expand my repertoire of musical proficiency from just classical.  Perhaps this would allow me to focus more on my guitar playing as well.""
B: ""I visit the city a lot and hear all kinds of music when I'm there.  Do you draw any inspiration from trips to the city?""
A: ""Yes. I have been to Carnegie hall before, which is basically the Mecca of classical music.  I have drawn most of my musical inspiration from concerts performed there.""
B: ""That's really cool.  I've always wanted to go to Carnegie Hall.  I'm not sure I could sit through a classical music concert though.""
A: ""My dad gave me the violin and it is in perfect condition. ""
B: ""Oh that's great! Are you going to hold onto it for special performances or play it as your everyday instrument?""
A: ""I haven't decided yet. Dad, being the virtuoso he was, played it every few days. I got my love of music from him. I might follow in his footsteps and continue playing it. But it's so beautiful I'm unsure.""
B: ""I can understand that. I'd be nervous with something beautiful and expensive. If I learn an instrument, I'm getting something cheap online to start so I don't mess it up.""
A: ""I know, right? Honestly part of me feels like I should mount the violin in a clear case and hang it on my wall of my tiny music room I have in my apartment. But my dad did love playing it so much. Getting something cheap online is a great idea. What would you say is the most prominent instrument in punk?""
B: ""Definitely guitar, though bass comes in a strong second. I think bass might be easier to learn because it has fewer strings.""
A: ""Huh, interesting, well I've played string instruments a lot during my life. But I'm so use to using them for classical purposes the idea of switching genres kinda scares me because what if I make a fool of myself? Classical is one thing, punk or any other genre is another.""
B: ""I don't listen to a lot of classical, but I think it would lend itself well to a lot of different styles right? Because it's so varied with tempo and feel. But I guess classical music also has a lot more ""rules"" than something like punk""
A: ""Yeah it does. If you mess up something like Mozart or Beethoven by even a note some teachers jump down your throat. My dad was always gentle with me regarding it but I had a piano teacher who was very fond of her ruler, lets say. When I teach, I'm always very gentle with my students. I wonder if I'd still be respected as a teacher if I did punk on the weekends, ha, ha.""
B: ""I think your students would respect you, can't say for sure about those former teachers!""
A: ""Ha, ha! Very true. Well, it's not like I'm doing anything on my weekends anyway so it'd be a good place to start. What's your favorite punk band? What would you recommend to a beginner?""
B: ""The Ramones are pretty classic punk, or The Clash but the genre has evolved a lot since they started out in the 70s""
A: ""What is your favorite punk band?""
B: ""I love both the Ramones and the Clash""
A: ""Great choice! I was thinking about doing a cover of some punk rock music. It might help me branch out from the classical world I've grown up in. Figured it might be cool to do a one man band and cover all five of the instruments I know. Maybe edit it and post in on YouTube. Do you know any singers that might be willing to collab? I won't dare sing myself.""
B: ""I would like to do that with you. I can sing pretty good!""
A: ""That's awesome! Is your range more like a tenor or a bass?""
B: ""My range is very broad, I can do both tenor and bass.""
A: ""Amazing! I'll work on putting together an arrangement. If it goes well, maybe we could even perform in person some day, though of course, we would need other musicians to play some of the instruments live. I'm getting ahead of myself here, but we could create a whole band! And eventually, as you get more comfortable with your guitar or bass learning, you could debut some of those skills as well.""
B: ""That would be great! I would love to both sing and play bass. I think our band would be very fun to see live.""
A: ""We just need a name! Any ideas? You're the punk rock enthusiast!""
B: ""How about Carnegie Punks? It's a reference to the two main styles of music that influence the band.""
A: ""Oh, that's a great idea! Some of the songs could start out with a classical intro on the piano, and then, BAM! The other instruments come in and we rock out hardcore. I can practically hear it already!""
B: ""Yeah, that sounds very unique. I think our band would be a big hit!""

A: ""Where can I listen to that series? I've been trying to find something to listen to on my daily commute to work""
B: ""The series is called ""Grown Local"" with Billy Wayne Davis, and they talk to local cannabis growers, about their history in the area. It makes me want to visit, as the forest sounds lovely, and the coast. If you have podcast recommendations, I'm listening!""

A: ""Maybe I am too focused on learning about tango that I dismiss the other type of dances... I think I will you with you, at what hour is your dance class ?""
B: ""My classes are all at night, usually 8PM.  In my last class, we listened to New Kids on the Block which was my favorite band when I was young.""
A: ""8 PM is perfect for me , I was not a fan of NKOTB when I was young, but I think now that they were very influential. What is the music group today that ressemble them the most ?""
B: ""They were definitely influential towards all those late 90's boy bands like NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys!""
A: ""Do you think the  Korean groups that we see now were influenced by them ?""
B: ""I think so.  Even the KPop groups have a very american sound because they know that's what sells.""
A: ""Do you still listen to them or listen to these new groups ? The kids that I teach to don't have any idea about them. ""
A: ""I got scheduled to supervise the kids in the after school detention this week. I might not be able to make that class with you.""
B: ""Supervising those bad kids sounds like a real drag. That's too bad, but the class this week is for ballroom dancing, and you can maybe come to next week's class, where we'll be learning the Argentine tango.""
A: ""That sounds great! I will plan for next week then. I don't think it is too many doing detention duty, a lot of the kids just need a little help and attention. ""

A: ""A trip to the beach would be great for you, especially if your brother could make it. Sometimes we have to make time for little trips away! Maybe take a few board games and play with your brother. ""

B: ""That is nice of you to want her happy.""
A: ""I meant my vows, even if I do not actually believe in god.""
B: ""Well maybe you'll meet someone new in a while""
A: ""How do you like your BMW? I'm thinking of getting a new car to cheer myself up.""
B: ""I love my new car! You should go down to the dealership and test drive some out! Even if you don't end up buying one it would be great fun.""
A: ""I hear that. I'd like to drive by my ex's house and see what she's up to.""
B: ""I don't know if a BMW is a very good stalking car. ""
A: ""What does a good stalking car look like? And where can I get one?""
B: ""These are thing I cannot answer unfortunately. You should get a BMW so you can score with new ladies! Have you been out on the dating scene at all?""
A: ""No, overweight people who work at nursing homes aren't very lucky with the ladies. What about you? Are you with someone?""
B: ""Yes... I am dating a wonderful nurse who is also overweight. Maybe your low self esteem is what drove your wife away.""
A: ""Maybe. Her new boyfriend is pretty cocky. But I hate cocky people.""
B: ""Yeah I don't like cocky people either, which is pretty weird since I own a BMW. ""
A: ""Ha! I own a Prius, which fits my low self-esteem.""
B: ""I saw a bumper sticker that said ""cool prius""- nobody. It made me laugh! Do you have any pets?""
A: ""What sort of job do you do and where do you work?""
B: ""I am a broker working in upper Manhatan. I love my job because it's fast pace and I get to negotiate deals and the money certainly doesn't hurt. Are you happy in your current career?""
A: ""I don't love my job and it definitely doesn't pay very well. I don't have any qualifications for anything else, though. It's frustrating. I want to go back to school I think. Maybe we can go to business school together lol""
B: ""I'm sorry to hear that. It is certainly never too late for change. Maybe this is your opportunity to make your dreams come true. What is something you've always wanted to do? I know I'm always learning something new and going to school wouldn't be a bad idea.""
A: ""I think I want to go back to school to be a nurse. I like helping people and get to do that in my current job, but would like to make more of an impact. I'm not the biggest fan of needles though...""
B: ""Nurses work very hard and help a lot of people. Good luck with your endevours. I abosolutely hate needles and have avoided them every since childhood. I freak out! Do you have to administer needles at your job?""
A: ""Not currently and thank goodness for that. I work more with bathing the people I help and feeding them. I guess if I can handle cleaning up elderly ""accidents"", I can learn to use needles.""
B: ""I would say so for sure! I'm glad you're helping to enrich others lives. You said you wanted a new car, what kind of car do you want?""
A: ""Ideally, I'd love a car that is good for the environment. I don't know if I'll ever be able to afford one in this lifetime, but that would be my #1 choice. Do you like your BMW?""
B: ""Telsa's are so good for that. I love their sleek style too. Very innovative. I don't have one yet but I'm thinking about gettinng one. Right now I have a G-Wagon, it's my dream car. It sits very high up. BMW are okay too I just never bought one. Do you know which car you would get that's good for the enviornment? ""
A: ""I don't know much about brands that are good for the environment. I know a little bit about Tesla, but I also know they're very expensive. Maybe I""
B: ""They are really expensive. I've seen some that were used but still in great condition but better priced. My husband work in sales and he trades them all the time. ""
A: ""Did you get hired right out of school for your current job?""
B: ""I did! Yale has great opportunities for internships. I actually couldn't attend my graduation because that was my first day of working full-time at my company. Have you thought more about going back to school? Whatever school you decide, you should definitely check what their connections are.""
A: ""Good for you! That's a good point. A future employer would probably want to know that I went to a reputable school. I need a change in my life because what I have right now isn't working for me.""
B: ""Where would you hope to work with your nursing degree if you don't want to work in a nursing home anymore?""
A: ""I'm thinking working in a hospital might be better. It's depressing to watch all these lonely old people slowly declining with no one to visit them. It's taking a toll on me emotionally.""
B: ""I bet! I feel like it would be just as stressful working in a fast paced hospital with emergency cases, but then again, you must have the heart and personality for it. I can hardly stomach stocks crashing, I can't imagine looking at graphs like that and knowing it's a person's vitals.""
A: ""You're right, it takes a lot of heart to be in this profession. How do you like your job right now? I'm sure that it can get just as stressful.""
B: ""Well, I'm still hoping to get into business school, but it would be paid for by my current job. It would be nice to have a little break from the long-term hours, and after completion of the program I'd automatically receive a raise, and also be eligible for all types of promotions. I love my company, but I'm definitely interested in finding out what other positions are out there.""
A: ""You have to do what's best for you. It's smart to keep an eye out for better opportunities. I hope the program works out for you.""
B: ""It sounds like we are both hopeful for better opportunities. This year is the year! I can feel it. Do you have any other goals for this year besides bettering your employment situation?""
A: ""This has to be the year! There's no other option. I'm hoping to be able to win back custody of my kids. It's unfair that their mother just took them away from me without the option of even being able to visit them.""
B: ""I know. I'm sorry to hear about your situation. Once your financial status changes, and you make better money, I think they will definitely have to take that into consideration! I know you haven't been able to visit the kids, but do you at least get to talk to them?""

B: ""Correct! I got it for my 18th yesterday!""
A: ""How is Nemo doing, is he adjusting to his new life in your house?""
B: ""yes ,he is happy , would you like to visit me and see Nemo ?""
A: ""I would love to visit, but it will have to be in a few months; the museum will be getting busier with field trips soon. Have you set up an aquarium for Nemo?""
B: ""no problem I will be waiting you when you are ready , yes I set up a pretty orange aquarium . what do think about the color ?""
A: ""I like orange a lot, especially together with other Fall colors like brown and yellow. Are there other fish in the aquarium? Or is it all for Nemo?""
B: ""I bought two other fishes , but Nemo is the oldest one ,he is friendly ,I think you love him very much ""
A: ""Watching fish is so peaceful and relaxing. I recently read an article that said many fish can respond to music; have you tried playing music for yours?""
B: ""no, I did not know about it but I think it will be a funny idea , what kind of music do you think that Nemo will like ?""
A: ""Maybe you should try classical music first, or something else that is slow and soothing.""
B: ""good Idea , I would like to try it when you visit me and drink fancy tea while watching Nemo""
A: ""That sounds like fun! I can bring a few of my favorite tea blends; I have an orange spiced tea that I am sure you would love.""
B: ""wow , great idea .. you made me happy , we will talk again an decide the visit time ""
A: ""I found a playlist of music that is especially suited to playing music for fish!""
B: ""Oh my god, that's amazing!  What kind of music is on the playlist?""
A: ""Mainly classical music, they like smooth calm stuff. ""
B: ""That makes sense.  I'm sure Nemo will love it!  Have you ever owned any fish?""
A: ""I have, but not anything big. I had a goldfish when I was younger and now I mainly have betta fish. ""
B: ""I figured you would have had a goldfish since you like the color orange so much!""
A: ""I do! It's such a nice color, it's also why I like bettas so much they're almost universally a mix of bright and dark colors. I love how orange just picks up my mood.""
B: ""I have always like orange too.  It can be such a bold color, I love the statement it makes.""
A: ""Same with the fruit right? Do you eat oranges for breakfast?""
B: ""I do eat oranges regularly, they are delicious.  I prefer apples and peaches, but I'll never turn down a good orange!""
A: ""One of the best things to do in the fall is going apple picking. We could go together, pick some apples, look at all the nice fall colors and then go back to yours and hang with nemo and make cider.""
B: ""Sounds perfect!  Maybe a quick stop by a museum on our way too!""
A: ""I've been playing this music for my fish every day for the last week! I don't think it's really doing anything.""
B: ""That is so funny. I have always wanted to play music for my fish. How many fish do you have?""
A: ""I have 2 beta fishes. They are both males. Males will fight each other, so I have to keep them in different tanks.""
B: ""I think I've heard that before. Beta fish are so interesting. Besides Nemo, I'm able to keep my fish together.""
A: ""That's good that you can keep them together, much more economical. how old is Nemo?""
B: ""Nemo is already 2 years old. I'm hoping he'll live a long time because he's my favorite. Anyways, I hear you work in a museum?""
A: ""Yes, I do! I am a tour guide in the Holocaust museum in Dallas. I love my job.""
B: ""That's so cool. I go to museums all the time. History is so fascinating.""
A: ""Yes I have always loved learning about the past, and what our past relatives and historical leaders went through.""

A: ""Thanks! I do what I can.""
B: ""Why have you not been skydiving?""
A: ""I just about faint when I climb a ladder. I cannot imagine a plane.""
B: ""Do not be afraid. It is exhilarating! The adrenaline rush can not be described in words.""
A: ""Do you want me to sign you up for food bank volunteering? Of course, if you have some free time""
B: ""Maybe this summer when school is out! Right now I am swamped with teaching and waitressing on the weekends. How is life going for you?""
A: ""Life is going well so far.  Staying extremely busy at the food bank. It seems more and more people are in need. ""
B: ""It is true! I have been seeing more children with food insecurities come through my classroom then ever before! ""
A: ""It really is a shame.  How does the school system handle the insecurities?""
B: ""There are a lot of kids who qualify for free meals so when school is in session they are getting at least two meals that day (breakfast and lunch). The summers are much harder. On the bright side the school has a new volunteer... a therapy dog kids can read to!""
A: ""That's awesome.  What's the dog's name?""
B: ""Dr. Woofington McBark! He is 5 years old and is a black lab.""
A: ""Dr. Woofington McBark...that's so funny.  I bet the kids love having him around.  Does he sit and listen to them reading?""
B: ""He usually lays down and sometimes he listens with his eyes closed, but he still is following the story! Yes the kids love having him around but so do all the teachers! He is such a self esteem boost to the kids struggling with sight words and sounding things out.""
A: ""I can imagine.  Dogs are a great comfort and can sense when something isn't right.  I know my Roscoe brightens my day each time I see him.  So loving and caring. ""
B: ""What kind of dog is he? ""
A: ""My dog and cat had a little fight yesterday""
B: ""Oh no, did either of them get hurt?""
A: ""Nah, it was more just like hissing and barking. ""
B: ""Wow... I can just imagine the noises.  It was probably really loud.  Are they getting along okay now?""
A: ""Yeah they seem to be getting along now that everything's settled. Mean Girl tried to grab some food from Roscoe's bowl and he wasn't having it. Like he saw her messing around in his bowl and went after her.""
B: ""I can believe.that.  Dogs can be very territorial.  How has volunteering been going?""
A: ""It's been going good, over the weekend I made a big amount of my mom's famous lemon chicken and brought it over to donate for that night's meal. It was a hit, thankfully.""
B: ""Oh, that sounds delicious.  We could use your cooking skills at our center.""
A: ""I could come over to help out for sure. I love volunteering. If I could do it as a career i would.""
B: ""That would be amazing.  We can use all the help we get.  Are you available this weekend?  ""
A: ""Yeah I am. I just can't leave my dog in my place, could I bring him with me?""
B: ""Sure.  He would be a big hit with the people coming in.  Give them some happiness with their meals.  ""
A: ""I left Roscoe at home and he tore up his dog bed!""
B: ""Oh no! I wonder if Mean Girl had something to do with it and set Roscoe up to take the fall haha""
A: ""Ha! That is definitely one way to look at it. But it was probably Roscoe. He had that guilty look on his face, you know?""
B: ""I sort of remember. I wish I was home more and could get a pet. Such good companions. Dr. McBark will have to do for now, but he has made me decide I want a lab if and when I do get a pet.""
A: ""I imagine he must be such a well-behaved dog! Labs are so sweet. I'm sure you'll have a pet someday. You see Dr. McBark at school lately?""
B: ""Yes, I see him around pretty often, but I try not to interfere with him too much so he can save his energy for the kids who need him. I'm going to schedule him to come to my class so the kids can read to him soon. ""
A: ""That's great! I'm sure they'll be really excited. Would be nice if we could get a therapy dog at the food bank. I'm sure a lot of people could use that comfort.""
B: ""That's true! Maybe you have an idea in there somewhere. Sadly, so many ideas that help the community require more funding than folks are willing to put in. It's so sad. It's so easy to see income disparities when I look at the kids in my classroom. It doesn't seem fair.  ""
A: ""It's not fair at all. I'm grateful that I'm able to at least make some difference, I just wish there wasn't a difference that needed to be made!""
B: ""Yes, and in my state teachers are so underpaid. That's why I have to wait tables too. I thought the purpose of society was to ultimately find a way where people can enjoy their lives instead of work work work. But no, instead all of the money lies in the hands of like 5 individuals. It's so gross.""
A: ""It definitely is. And being a teacher is such an important and difficult job too. There's no reason a teacher (or anybody) should NEED a second job!""
B: ""Exactly! A reliable salary is nice, but when I take what I make and break it down by the hour, it's indentured servitude basically. Not to mention the supplies and things I buy out of my own pocket because there's no room in the school budget for them. It's all such a mess. I'm sure you see so much of this and much worse at the food bank. If I ever got rich, I'd give so much back to my community. Truly! I wish everyone felt that way. Maybe seeing all the kids in my class makes me more empathetic to the struggles.""

B: ""I have bought bitcoin. Just for fun though. I am nervous about it and it is not my main method of investment. Do you own any?""
A: ""No as its a pretty big leap for me to invest my money just yet. Now that I'm single I need to focus on life and work. How did you come to make your fortune? ""
B: ""I made my money through investing mostly in real estate. Buy your first house and rent it out. Let your roommates pay your mortgage and then save up to buy another house to rent and repeat. You own the house someone else pays the debt.""
A: ""Very true and smart. The first step is being able to buy the house with little to no work to be done. A turnkey so to speak.""
B: ""No expect a little work. Make it livable. People who rent generally aren't looking for all the amenities. They want and affordable place to live that is safe and comfortable. Provide that""
A: ""Ok I understand, then the next step is having two houses or own one and rent it then rent somewhere else. That's where is can be tricky as far as affording both between renters.""
B: ""It can be. make sure you have enough cash to float you to the next renter, but other than that it is on autopilot. Do you think you will buy a house soon now?""
A: ""Maybe, the market is great for that right now so trying to be approved for a home loan first. My credit is not bad, but also not great.""
B: ""FHA loans are available for 0 down. they will still look at your income to debt ratio as the most important thing, but it is easy to be approved and then it will actually increase your credit while someone else makes payments on your debt. Just find a roommate.""
A: ""Will do since my fish isn't bring in any money. Nobody wants to pay to see him.""
B: ""exactly and you are young, so think about it this way too every dollar you earn is worth 2-3 times as much as each dollar I earn when invested.""
A: ""How is your Bitcoin investment paying off?  ""
B: ""It's going okay, not the levels I wanted originally.""
A: ""Bitcoin is such a volatile investment, I don't know how you can stand the swings""
B: ""Honestly? it's anxiety inducing as hell. I don't use a lot amount of money, especially with this""
A: ""I get it, I could never handle that stress.  That's why I have a pet goldfish - it's very relaxing.""
B: ""Oh right you were telling me about getting him, how's that going for you? Is he being a good... fish?""
A: ""He's a great fish!  I named him Nemo after my favorite movie!""
B: ""Nemo is a really good movie. Did you get him to distract you from the breakup?""
A: ""Actually, yes.  It was a really difficult time and having something else to focus on was really helpful...even though he doesn't talk.""
B: ""He might not talk but I'm sure he's a good listener. ""
A: ""Haha, yes.  Have you ever had a goldfish?""
B: ""No, I haven't. The only pet I ever had was a cat that I grew up with.""
A: ""I taught Nemo a trick! If he learns a few maybe people will pay to see him perform.""
B: ""I didn't realize you could teach fish tricks .I would like to see it. What kind of trick is it?""
A: ""Nemo can twirl and do somersaults!  He is very food motivated.""
B: ""That is amazing! I would never attempt to train a fish. I haven't even tried to train my cat, and she isn't stuck in a bowl lol. What else can you teach him?""
A: ""I don't know if I have taught him, but when I approach the bowl with food, Nemo blows bubbles, almost like he is trying to talk.  It's quite amazing.""
B: ""I should come by sometime and check that out. Have you thought any more about maybe investing? ""
A: ""I have, but am worried about losing money.  Any thoughts?  Right now I have some money earning 25 basis points in an online bank account.""
B: ""I would advise that if you do decide to do it, only put in what you are ok with losing. I am so nervous every time I check mine, and I am regretting putting in so much. If I had started smaller, maybe it would be more fun.""
A: ""I am thinking of perhaps just doing an S&P500 index ETF.  I believe I can start with as little as $100 and do $50 additional each month.  Do you think that makes sense for a risk averse investor like me?""
B: ""As long as you could stand to lose it, then yeah. It would be perfect. I was told a bit late to only invest what you can afford to spend. ""
A: ""That is good advice.  For me, that would mean don't risk losing my goldfish!""
B: ""Yeah exactly. But I have almost doubled my investment. I did see it dip really low twice though and so now I am nervous it will go down and not back up.""

A: ""I think it might be a bit too much to do both unless it's a special occasion. Or it will seem like you're trying too hard to impress her. One gesture at a time is best, I think""

A: ""I guess there's only one way to find out!  Would you take one trip to France and Belgium, or split them up?""

A: ""How old is she?  That sounds like it would be a great way to bond with her.""
B: ""She's 18, going to turn 19 next year and she's thinking of taking some time off before going to college so if I keep working until then and take the time to retire we could go together.""
A: ""Wow, that sounds great!  Does your daughter take French in school?""
B: ""She did actually, she started learning it and I started to help her study for her tests. She speaks much better than I do and was taking about going to France to maybe be an english teacher. I took chinese when I was in school and it's been my passion language. ""

B: ""It's amazing to think about just how much history there is! I wish I could stay longer to see it all.""
A: ""I am betting you could set up a map where you could visit the biggest attractions or most important event places and see a lot. At least in France for sure. When do you plan to go again?""
B: ""I'm going this summer with my daughter. It works since she doesn't have summer school. I'll see if I can bring you back some Belgian chocolate!""
A: ""Oh that would be A MA ZING. I have never had any real real Belgian chocolate. I have tried the fake stuff sold here, but I feel that everything is better where it originated.""
B: ""I imagine the real thing is a life changer. You have a point. Maybe I'll try some authentic French bread too.""
A: ""Oh yeah, they have so many kinds, but I heard it is best fresh so you gotta get it early!""
B: ""There's no other way! Haha the bread might expire before I could bring you some back so sorry, no bread for you haha""
A: ""That is fine. I would be so happy to get some of that chocolate. I have always daydreamed about trying it fresh at the factory though haha.""
B: ""In that case, maybe I could steal you away for the summer. We aren't getting any younger. The time is now, Ali! You have to fulfill your dreams!""
A: ""You know what? I love that idea! I will start putting back some money and I will be glad to go. Just gotta see about a passport. ""

A: ""So cool. How much to rent it?""
B: ""5000 week. Definitely worth doing at some point in your life!""
A: ""Hmmm maybe. I would rather put that towards bitcoin.""
B: ""I'm not familiar with that""
A: ""Make lots of money, keep these gains I'll be able to buy 20 yachts.""
B: ""Wow! That sounds so interesting!""
A: ""The Aerosmith concert was fantastic! It was one of their best.""
B: ""That sounds like a lot of fun! It's been too long since I've been to a concert. Do you go to concerts regularly?""
A: ""Yes! I try to go to as many as I can. Work allowing of course lol""
B: ""I've been thinking about changing jobs recently. I feel like I need to get outdoors more, or at least have a change of venue.""
A: ""Outdoors is great no doubt. I know it's a different thing, but I much prefer outdoor concerts to inside ones.""
B: ""They had one in my area this weekend. We have a beautiful outdoor amphitheater and there's usually a summer concert series in town.""
A: ""Oh that sounds really fun! Did you get to go?""
B: ""I only walked by because they were sold out. I am hoping to get tickets to one later this summer, though. I think it would be a lot of fun. Do you have a favorite kind of  band to see?""
A: ""That's a bummer, but hopefully you can check it out later this year! I really enjoy rock concerts.""
B: ""I think they have them from June through September if I remember correctly. I also love rock concerts, but the last one I've been to live was a long time ago. It's been like 10 years ago. ""
A: ""You should go to one this year! If of course you can find one you want to see.""
B: ""I think it's a pretty mixed bag for the concert in the park series. I think they have everything from polka to rock. I should check the calendar and see! I know our community is known for having lots of community events and most of them are free. It's a blast.""
A: ""I would enjoy going to a rock concert with you. ""
B: ""I would love to go. But, it's been awhile so it's going to be a little wired.""
A: ""It'll only be wierd at first, after the first set, it'll seem like old times.""
B: ""Maybe! So, how much is the concert tickets?""
A: ""How much are the tickets??? C'mon, you have a yacht!!  I actually paid in Bitcoin, so not sure of the dollar equivalent.""
B: ""That's right! I am not worried about the cost. I was just curious, since i have never been to the concert in 10 years. ""
A: ""Ah, that makes sense.  Ticket are $150, or about 5 hours of yacht rental!  Hey, would you consider allowing us to use the yacht?  The concert is on the French Riviera.""
B: ""Wow, that's a great idea! Sure we can! So, are you inviting any of your friends to the concert?""
A: ""I had not invited anyone yet because I wasn't sure if you would be willing to allow us to use the yacht.  How many people would the yacht comfortably fit?""
B: ""10 crew. I think i have a couple of friends who would join, so you can ask around 6-7 people. ""
A: ""Perfect.  One of the people I will ask to go has made a bundle investing in crypto currencies and I know he is looking to purchase a yacht, so if you are looking to sell, I can introduce you.""
B: ""Perfect! Actually i am not in the idea of selling it right now, but i will keep in mind, if i change my plan in the future. ""
A: ""I talked to my friends about going to the concert on your yacht and they're really excited.""
B: ""That is great to hear!  They get to avoid all that nasty traffic and just enjoy a nice relaxing cruise to the port which is only two miles from the venue!  I am kicking myself a bit for not getting tickets sooner, but I know they are heading a little further south in a month or so and may get tickets then.""
A: ""That is sad to hear I wish you were going with us! Live music is always better than listening to a soundtrack in my opinion!""
B: ""I'm just glad you talked everyone into the Yacht.  Skipper Tim will be the one piloting the vessel and you couldn't ask for a better person at the helm!  You may never want to travel by car again.  ""
A: ""I do like driving! I'm a big fan of road trips! Do you always travel by yacht?""
B: ""It really depends.  I like to keep her in the ocean so I don't venture much into the rivers or lakes.  So if I am doing business or pleasure away from the sea, I will be driving instead.  ""
A: ""Very cool! When did you get your first yacht?""
B: ""I had been renting one with friends for a few years, but I finally splashed some cash about seven years ago.  Best investment I ever made to be honest.  It's allowed me to travel so much.  If I ever leave my job, I need something that gives me a lot of flexibility with travel!""
A: ""Wow that is so cool! I am still saving to buy a house I can't even imagine purchasing a yacht!""
B: ""Well, I got a little lucky with stocks, but don't think I didn't work my butt off.  Your ship (even if it isn't a yacht) will be coming in soon!  I can feel it.  I don't know much about Bitcoin, but I just read that it was really looking strong.  ""
A: ""Haha thank you! Hopefully one day I will have my own yacht and my own home! The stock market can be a good way to make money!""
B: ""Just have to follow the trends.  You are doing pretty well to hop on Bitcoin, but pay attention and know when it's time to abandon ship.  Another boat metaphor!  I can't help myself...throw me a life preserver. ""

A: ""I have been deployed many places, most notably Afghanistan. It was not all bad, I got to try new food which is always nice. How is the volunteer work going?""
B: ""Volunteering work is great, we get to assist where there is dire need of assistance. Have yo ever tried mexican food?""
A: ""Yes, I have. I am a big fan of quesadillas. I am sure there has to be some great mexican restaurants in California. Maybe next time I am there we can grab a bite to eat and you can show me around. ""

B: ""Sure, you are welcome anytime. How is it serving in the military?""
A: ""It can be very rewarding, but not always. It is hard seeing the things we do, but knowing we are helping people counteracts the downsides to it. Have you ever thought about joining?""
B: ""Sure, at some point before I joined college but i got discouraged by some of my friends.Maybe I will try again this year ""
A: ""What branch of the armed forces did you consider joining?""
B: ""I considered joining the Army because my brother is currently there. Why did you decide to join the army?""
A: ""Coming from a military family I guess I just grew up with a respect for it, wanting to serve my country. It's interesting how it's at least somewhat common for people to go into jobs similar to their parents. For me it's a life I was familiar with ""
B: ""I completely agree and understand. When you were traveling, which place did you like the most? I have never traveled out of state, but I would like to go to Mexico some day!""
A: ""Mexico is great! I went once, only got to stay briefly but it was beautiful. The food is so much better than Mexican restaurants. I think my favorite was Japan though""
B: ""I guess I will have to go sooner than expected, just to try out their delicious food! What dish would you recommend?""
A: ""Honestly I'd really recommend street vendors. It sounds obvious but the tacos are sooo good. Elotes are great too, it's street corn""
B: ""I've never has street corn, but it sure does sound delicious! All Mexican dishes are delicious, I think we can both agree on that! LOL! Especially spicy food. Do you prefer spicy or non-spicy? ""
A: ""I love spicy but my tolerance is lower than I want it to be. The pain is so good haha, but I don't like it when I can still feel it on my tongue like 15 minutes later haha. Have you ever done something like a hot wing competition? ""
B: ""Haha, agreed. I actually have! I did one 3 years ago with a friend of mine at this restaurant called ""Wings and Things,"" we had to sign a waiver because of how spicy it was! Sadly, my friend and I didn't last long.. But the experience was fun!""
A: ""Oh man that sounds so fun. I've never done a spicy contest, but I did try to finish this giant burger where if you finish it you don't have to pay. I fasted all day but I only got about 4/5 of the way through, alas!""
B: ""Oh darn! All that matters is that you tried! How bad was the stomach ache after? LOL! ""
A: ""Have you thought about what you want to specialize in if you join the army?""

B: ""I might get into it. A lot of the meals I like to make at home incorporate fresh vegetables and fruits, especially my favorite Hispanic dishes. Maybe I could look into growing cinnamon.""

A: ""Have you ever thought about trying your hand at it? I honestly find it really relaxing, and it is great not having to rely on anyone else for fresh veggies!""
B: ""I have thought about it, but between my job and my volunteer work I just don't think I have the time it requires to keep it up.""
A: ""That totally makes sense. If you ever get the free time, I highly recommend it! It can be a nice break from the stress of your job too.""

A: ""Who does not love cheeseburgers? That's my jam""
B: ""I'm retired, I was a gym teacher""
A: ""Whoa I can not even imagine retiring yet. I am so young""
B: ""Yeah I volunteer at the soup kitchen a lot now""
A: ""I should do that. I have all this free time since I broke my arm""
B: ""Yeah, its a good cause""
A: ""I spend a lot of time on my skateboard. Hence the arm""
B: ""Oh fun, yeah your favorite skateboarder is rob""
A: ""Good guess. Rob dryden can really shred""
B: ""Yeah he sure can he used to be a salesman, door to door""
A: ""Whatever pays the bills man. That's how I see it""
B: ""Yeah yeah, man, for sure""
A: ""Did you ever skate, before you retired?""
B: ""Yeah, I used to skate on the ocean blues""
A: ""I am so excited! I just visited my doctor, and she says that I should be able to get my cast off next week.""
B: ""Lets goooo!!! That must be exiting for you! Are you going to be skateboarding again?""
A: ""Absolutely, I actually spend the last 8 weeks while I was in a cast helping my buddy build a ramp in my backyard.  I am ready!""
B: ""That's awesome! My little brother and I used to go down to a skate park in our early teens. We only had one skateboard growing up but we made it work.""
A: ""I feel like I grew up in a skatepark.  I mostly built my own boards so I never had the best, but I actually think not having the best equipment made me a better skateboarder.  ""
B: ""The skatepark was the place to be as a kid. Honestly i never thought about building my own board. How was that experience?""
A: ""It sort of felt like rebuilding a sprocket on a bike a lot of times.  We built lots of things.  My favorite may have been the cannon we made in metal shop that we actually fired!""
B: ""That cannon must of been awesome in my college days we went to a friends farm one time and we placed a cannon in the bed of my pickup and we drove around firing at the targets we made. You seem like you built a lot of things are you an engineer? ""
A: ""Nah, not an engineer, just a cheeseburger loving dude with an active imagination and willingness to try and fail at things.  The cannon thing took 3 times before we were successful!""
B: ""I could honestly go for a cheeseburger right, i've been wanting one of those burger king crowns recently. But what other projects have you worked on?""
A: ""Currently working on a potato launcher.  Hoping to be able to launch a potato at least 100 yards.""
B: ""I've seen some cool things been done with potato launchers in the past. With all of these projects you are working on you should open a cheeseburger restaurant that displays all of your creations.  ""
A: ""I finished the potato launcher!""
B: ""That's awesome!!! How many potatoes have you launched already?""
A: ""Went through a 5 pound bag yesterday!  I think I need to step up to the 50 pound bag, either that or I need to plant potatoes!""
B: ""Whoa! That's so many! Have you tried launching any from your cannon? haha!""
A: ""Nah, but I did launch a marble that I think went through a window three blocks away!""
B: ""Oh man! Was anybody injured?""
A: ""I don't think so, but I didn't stay around to find out...I took off and hid in my basement for an hour.""
B: ""Yeah, you have enough to deal with already with your broken arm! How was your doctor's visit by the way? Any good news?""
A: ""Good news on the arm, it is healing nicely, but my blood work results came back and I may have a thyroid issue.""
B: ""I'm really sorry to hear that! I hope now you can get some answers and start feeling better. But who am I kidding, no one can keep you off that skateboard of yours!""
A: ""No doubt, I just finished the artwork on my newest creation.  It has a Game of Thrones motif, complete with dragons!""
B: ""How cool! Will you be taking it down the ramp in your backyard any time soon?""
A: ""Have you had the opportunity to get back to skateboarding?""
B: ""No, I think I'm too old to skateboard now! My body can't take the falls! How was your doctor's appointment?""
A: ""Good. He just checked out my arm. My cast needs to stay on for another month.""
B: ""That's what I was talking about! I can't handle those breaks anymore! Did you break your arm falling off your skateboard?""
A: ""Yeah I was trying to go down a large set of stairs. Almost made it too! When did you skate last?""
B: ""Not since I was a kid! My brother and I used to skateboard all the time. I went to college and didn't bring my board and I just never skated again. Crazy. It's been 30 years.""
A: ""Does your brother still skate? What does he do for a living?""
B: ""No way! He is in his 50s and he's an insurance agent! Skateboarding doesn't go with his image now. Ha ha!""
A: ""True! So where did you learn to make cannons?""
B: ""In my college fraternity! No professional training, we just sort of figured it out ourselves!""
A: ""I learned in high school believe it or not. My teacher had no clue that's what I was up to! So who makes your favorite cheeseburger? Mine is In n Out.""
B: ""I bet that teacher would have been surprised! In N out is great but I'm partial to the classic Big Mac. I know the quality is bad, but I just love it!""

B: ""It was usually being with my children but I am divorced and she took the kids""
A: ""So sad, I'm sorry, I want to make it big someday.""

A: ""Wow big family, married? I am single but looking.""
B: ""I am divorced and I hpe to find someone else once I work on myself""
A: ""What kinds of things do you do at your nursing home job?""
B: ""I get the patients what they need, help turn them over in their beds if necessary, and help with toileting.""
A: ""Fascinating! How long have you been working at the nursing home for?""
B: ""About 10 years now. I've met some interesting people, but I would like to get a different job.""
A: ""That makes sense. What kind of job would you prefer instead? Would you wanna do something music related?""
B: ""I was just thinking you should start a band and I could be your manager. How fun would that be??""
A: ""That sounds amazing! Should I start a folk band?""
B: ""Absolutely! Or you could be a solo artist. Maybe that's the way to go?""
A: ""That could work as well. Maybe you and I could come up with our own style combining folk and jazz. What instruments do you play?""
B: ""I can play the sax, but honestly I'm not very good. I think you'd be much better off without me playing!""
A: ""Wish my parents believed in me more. We should brainstorm this some more. Maybe you could do a sax solo for one of my tracks.""
B: ""I don't get why parents can't just support whatever we want to do with our lives. I try to do that for my kids. Definitely, let's brainstorm. Are you around this weekend?""
A: ""I found some great soul music I can play for you.""
B: ""That's awesome! Can you play it on the piano?""
A: ""I have tried and don't have the song perfected yet. I am working on it. Maybe you could join in with your saxaphone!""
B: ""That would be great! If it's easier for you to play it on the guitar, that would be cool, too!""
A: ""I will have to try on the guitar and see which I prefer. Maybe I can play both for you and you can tell me which sounds better?""
B: ""That would be awesome! I found some folk music we can also try.""
A: ""My favorite! I can not wait! Do you ever play music for the patients at the nursing home?""
B: ""Yes! One of the patients I'm closest with used to be a theater teacher, so I'll play things from musicals and she will sing along.""
A: ""That is awesome. I would guess it makes their day! Maybe I can bring my guitar sometime and play at the nursing home with you.""
B: ""That sounds great! I bet if we post a video on YouTube, it will get some views! We could go viral, and that would be your big break!""
A: ""Maybe it could be my big break. Let's do it! And the very least we can hopefully spread the appreciation for jazz and folk music. ""
B: ""If we became famous, then we wouldn't have to clean for a living anymore!""
A: ""How long do you see yourself cleaning for a living?""
B: ""With the pay that I get probably the rest of my life, but I have to do it for my three kids""
A: ""I understand, kids always come first. Maybe you'll find yourself in a different industry one day, you never know. Have you ever made any money from playing the sax? ""
B: ""I haven't to be honest, I don't think I am good enough for that. I thought about starting a YouTube channel playing my sax, but I wouldn't know where to start""
A: ""Oh that's a good idea. I have also thought about doing that. My friend has a channel where she makes videos of her playing the double bass and she says you just have to start and you'll keep improving and growing your audience. Is there much music at the nursing home? ""
B: ""Not really, but they aren't paying me to do that. I mean if they wanted to give me something extra every day I played I would totally consider it. The residents might actually like it. Especially the jazz I can play, but what if they hate it?""
A: ""Oh I'm sure that would be so helpful to them, music always makes life better imo. You deserve to get paid for it though! I love jazz, who is your favourite jazz musician? ""
B: ""I has got to be Louie Armstrong, I mean he is amazing. And thank you for saying I deserve to get paid for it. I'll bring it up next time I go to work. Do you have a favorite jazz musician?""
A: ""Oh I agree, I love him too. My favourite is John Coltrane though. You definitely should ask at work I think. Do you prefer classic r&b? Or are there more recent artists you like? ""
B: ""Kenny G is actually my sax inspiration, he has been playing for a while, but still does. I like it all though, soul music is so beautiful ""
A: ""Big fan of Kenny G! But yes, as much as I love folk best, there is something very special about soul! ""
B: ""There really is, its wonderful that we live in a time where all that music can just be in our pocket to listen to whenever we want""

B: ""I wish I knew more about cryptocurrencies.  I can't wrap my head around it.  The gambling site I use offers betting and payouts in various crytpos.""
A: ""Crypto's are the worst investment because of the volatility but i am so desperate to get out of customer service i decided to take the risk and purchase doge coin when it wasnt even a penny and sold out recently to a nifty pay day.""
B: ""Good move on your part.  It's funny, I don't have a problem gambling at a casino, or on sports, but when it comes to investments, I avoid risk and keep money parked in Tbills.""
A: ""I don't usually go to a Casinos mainly because they aren't legal in my state but i love trading in the stock market because i want that financial freedom in my life.""
B: ""how do you pick winners?  I have always had a knack for picking winners in European soccer, but stocks are like a foreign language to me.""
A: ""If you win on this bet, why not take some of the money and invest it in stocks? You can start off very small until you get used to how it works. You may be good at it since you're good at gambling.""
B: ""That sounds interesting but I'm quite nervous about it. Have you any tips? Do you dabble in stocks? Or just cryptocurrencies?""
A: ""I'm just doing crypto investments at the moment.  The markets been moving up so I've been selling.  The secret is to have a plan when to sell and stick to it.""
B: ""Maybe I'll have a look around, start small. If I get the hang of things and find some sources for good tips then I'll invest a little more. How's work been?""
A: ""You know, I envy you.  I hate going to work, but I'm not in a position to retire yet.  How's your sports betting going?""
B: ""It's going alright, not many wins this week. But it's the end of the soccer season, so it gets a bit harder to predict. Retirement is great, but it's also a bit of a sign that my life is coming to its end stages. You've still got your youth!""
A: ""I know you can't buy more time, so I agree youth is good, but why does it have to be full of unpleasant work?  I'm enjoying the soccer at the moment.  Leicester City beat Manchester United last night, I wish could have bet on that, I'd have made a killing.""
B: ""It's easy to see the results after they've happened though! I often end up betting on wins/losses, I never really bet on a draw, and often that's the result! I've lost many an accumulator that way. Have you considered changing jobs? ""
A: ""You know, that has been on my mind.  It's a balance of security at the store versus doing something more fun but not so certain long term.  What would you do?""
B: ""I used to work in healthcare. I found that rewarding. At least you know your job will never get taken over by a robot! What might you be interested in doing? Maybe something that isn't customer facing!""
A: ""Yep, they're always right even when they're wrong those customers.  In my opinion they deserve robot service! On what I want to do, I like being outdoors.  I thought about applying to be a park ranger.""
B: ""That sounds great! Being outdoors and exploring. You should look to apply, you don't even need to make any decisions until you're actually offered a job""
A: ""So, I made the leap and applied for the park ranger job...and got it! I am so excited. I got my uniform today and I've gotta say, I look pretty sharp.""
B: ""That's awesome!! Congrats! I didn't know that you were interested in that career.""
A: ""I am excited to have a job that lets me work outdoors. I think I will really enjoy this job and am glad to no longer work in customer service. ""
B: ""That's true, my last job working with customers got exhausting at times. So what does your schedule look like? I'm actually having a party at my house to watch the football game and would love for you to come. ""
A: ""I work weekdays from 9am-5pm and have weekends off. What day and time is the party for the football game? ""
B: ""Perfect, it'll be this coming Sunday, and you can come around 3pm. What kind of food is your favorite? Do you drink alcohol?""
A: ""I really enjoy potato chips. I do like alcohol, especially vodka. I can't wait to come over this Sunday!""
B: ""Great! The weather is getting a lot warmer so we'll probably be grilling outside too. I'll be sure to have some vodka for you! My favorite is probably whiskey.  ""
A: ""I do love the outdoors so it will be nice to enjoy food outside. I appreciate the hospitality and look forward to sharing stories from my new job. ""
B: ""I am excited to hear all about your new job. Just checked the weather and it looks like it's going to be 80 degrees! I'm looking forward to it as well! It'll be a fun time.""
A: ""I enjoy warm weather, I am glad that summer is finally here. What else should I expect from the party?""
B: ""I'll be having a lot of my friends over, but if you would like to invite anyone feel free as well! It'll just be a great time watching the football game, relaxing, and grilling. I also have a pool in my backyard if you would like to bring a bathing suit. ""

B: ""That's definitely a good goal, I've also been trying to eat less meat. I want to be more healthy, but I also learned about how bad it is for the environment to be eating red meat.

B: ""Yes! Remember, my favorite place to travel is Dubai. I think Dubai is really cool because of how futuristic it is. Did you know that it is almost entirely man-made, including all the rivers and of course the exceptional skyscrapers? They made a whole city where there was just a desert.

B: ""Dad is happy with what I choose, as long as I am happy. I'm grateful to have a father who lets me choose my own path. Any tractor stories to share lately? ""
A: ""That's awesome. Some parents can be very pushy that their kid do the same type of service they did, so that's really nice of him. Nothing interesting on the tractors lately, although I am going to a big show this weekend. Should have some of the biggest tractors in the country!""
B: ""Tractor shows can be a nice walk. I wander through the different rigs,  and get impressed at all the powerful tools. Was listening to piano music lately, what classical music are you into? ""
A: ""I've been trying to got more into Chopin lately. Beethoven is my favorite but I'm trying to expand my collection. How about you?""
B: ""If you love Chopin, check out the movie ""Impromptu"" with Hugh Grant as Chopin, Judy Davis as George Sands, his long time partner. They were very different personalities! Love it. Lately I've been digging Windham Hills music. ""
A: ""I've needed a good movie to watch lately too so that's two birds with one stone! Thanks for the recommendation. I love Judy Davis. She always picks such great roles.""
B: ""Judy Davis is a force of nature in the role, and is a great balance to Chopin. Chopin's music can just melt you away, was it the Etudes? ""
A: ""It was the Polonaise, but I need to become better acquainted with the Etudes, for sure""
B: ""They refer to the Etudes in that movie, Impromptu, that I mentioned. It's a bit of fiction too, but I love seeing the music through their eyes, in their world. Are their other Chopin songs you like? ""

B: ""Thats great! How was the tractor show? Any new leads on what you may want to purchase when you are done saving up?  What new tunes did you listen to?""
A: ""The show was really fun! Nothing like being surrounded by hundreds of tractors and thousands of tractor lovers. I listened to Miley Cyrus. I'd never heard of her before, but I liked it.""
B: ""Ahh Miley is a bit out of my listening pervue, I've been relieving stress from work by playing classical piano pieces lately.  I wish I had more time to do outdoorsy stuff like tractor shows.  Is it just tractors or other farm equipment stuff too?""

B: ""Yeah it's like an electric pressure cooker thing, it cooks things very quickly! I've made mushroom risotto in it and it only took 6 minutes of pressure cooking!""

B: ""Oh nice! That sounds similar to the instapot. There is something about soup that just nourishes the soul. I just watched the classic Seinfeld episode ""The Soup Nazi"" and now I really want to go to NYC and try his soup haha.""
A: ""Haha I've never seen that episode, what's the premise? I'm assuming delicious soup is involved? And yes I agree, soup is so lovely and warming in cold weather!""

B: ""I wonder if there are many places to ride horses in Georgia?""
A: ""I started researching our area and there are couple of farms not too far away.  I would love to buy land one day and own a couple of horses myself. What other animals do you have on your farm?""
B: ""We are mainly a horse farm, but we have a couple of goats and a big fat pig.""
A: ""We have planned a trip to Kentucky after the baby is born! ""
B: ""That sounds like a hassle but you can't go anywhere without her haha. I'm sure you guys will have fun. I would love to have you guys over at my ranch.""
A: ""That sounds like a blast! I'm sure the baby would enjoy it.""
B: ""The horses are very gentle so I'm sure she'd like to watch them. I think it would be a good exposure to big animals for her.""
A: ""What are your horses names?""
B: ""Siegfried, Beowulf, and Hector. Hector can be a brat sometimes but they're all good at heart. ""
A: ""What awesome names! I really hope the baby enjoys the company of horses. Though, it might be a bit too much to get enough land and then take care of the horses on top of the baby. Maybe when she's a bit older we'll look into it more seriously.""
B: ""It is a lifestyle. You kind of have to go all in with horses for them to thrive. But hey, you can always come to the ranch for a free trial!""
A: ""I'll definitely have to take you up on that. It's been so long since I've been to a horse farm!""
B: ""Awesome! You'll have a nice, hearty breakfast waiting for you each morning! You'll need it too because I might ask for your help mucking the stalls.""
A: ""Of course! I would love to get my hands dirty in there feel free to call on me at any time.""
B: ""I'm excited to see all of you!! Oh man... I have so much work to do to get the ranch ready. It'll be worth it though.""

A: ""Good day to you how are you doing today?""
B: ""I am well, thank you. How are you?""
A: ""Not so good. My ford pinto broke down on me today""
B: ""Sorry to hear. Is that a mini van? I drive one.""
A: ""Yeah it is. I'm sadden because its going to cost me alot of money to fix""
B: ""Oh dear. Hope you sort it out. You have kids?""
A: ""No I do not but I have nephews that come over from time to time""
B: ""Family is good. I love spending time with my five sons.""
A: ""Oh yeah! That is awesome. I love playing call of duty with my nephews lots of it""
B: ""Not really into games. I prefer a glass of wine in the evenings.""
A: ""I've to try that. What kind of wine to you recommend""
B: ""You cannot go wrong with a cabernet.""
A: ""Awesome I gotta try it one day. What do you do on weekends for fun?""
B: ""Just grab a refreshment somewhere. Coffee is my favorite beverage.""
A: ""I love the new maps in Call of Duty.""
B: ""I just can't get into video game how do you do it?""
A: ""You have to find something you really enjoy. What are some of the things you like to do?""
B: ""I like to drink wine and coffee. Not sure how that would help.""
A: ""I don't think there are many video games based off of drinking. I would suggest sticking with board games with friends and family. What are some wines you recommend?""
B: ""My favorite are sparkling wines. I love Alma Libre White Blend. Another good one if you are just starting out would be Sauvetage Rose.""
A: ""Thanks for the recommendations! I find wine hard to get into because the taste is so different from regular drinks. I don't think I""ll be drinking it often, but I think it's good to have something in mind for special occasions.""
B: ""I hear that a lot. Some people just can't get into wine. I just enjoy a glass after a hard day at work or chasing after my sons.""
A: ""How are your kids doing now? I imagine that five sons must make for a lot of trouble around the house.""
B: ""They are good. The twins just got into football so that will be fun.""
A: ""Cool, sports are really great. Maybe that would be a good starting point if you want to get into video games. There are quite a lot of video games based around sports that you can play with your kids. ""
B: ""Yeah that is a great idea. Maybe I will look into some or see what is out there. I'm sure there is some game for a mom to relax playing.""
A: ""If you had to choose between coffee and wine and the one you do not choose goes away forever, which would you choose?""
B: ""Oh gosh that is a tough one. Why would you do this to me? I like coffee, but I LOVE wine. If I absolutely have to choose, I would keep wine and get rid of coffee. If you had to choose, would you keep your Pinto or your nephews?""
A: ""I'd of course keep my nephews! The expense on my Pinto is far too great and I love my nephews way too much to let them go! How are your twins?""
B: ""The twins are playing football in the park with some other kids right now. I worry because they get a little rough with it sometimes. Maybe your nephews could play with them sometime.""
A: ""I think that would be a lot of fun. Do your twins like video games?""
B: ""They play video games sometimes. They like the Madden games of course. I know your nephews like COD, but do they get into any of the sports games you mentioned?""
A: ""They mostly play COD, but they will really play anything. We could sit and watch them play, you'll have wine and I'll have coffee, how does that sound?""
B: ""Oh you know I don't like video games. There's not enough wine in the world to rope me into that one.""
A: ""You don't have to play! We could just watch them play! Or you could show me that fancy mini van of yours and tell me about work haha.""
B: ""We can let the kids play video games and talk about our vehicles on the back porch, enjoying the weather. How about that?""
A: ""Sounds great. What is your favorite season?""
B: ""Definitely the fall. It's not too hot, but it's also sparkling wine season. Call me biased, but I love that stuff. ""
A: ""I took your recommendation- I tried the Sauvetage Rose. It was actually quite tasty.""
B: ""Where did you buy it ? At a wine store ?""
A: ""I got it at the local supermarket - they had a decent selection! I need to hit up the wine store next to expand my tastes""
B: ""Yeah, most of wine store have people who already tasted the wines that they are selling. It is better than me recommending you wines that are not in your area. ""
A: ""I still don't really like wine that much - i think i'm happy sticking to my regular coffee and wine every once in while! How are your boys getting on""
B: ""Don't replace your coffee with wine, especially at work. My boys are all ok, I am trying to get into videogames because of the twins. And you, how are your nephews ?""
A: ""They're doing great, I had them round here earlier today and we knocked out a few games of COD! They just love videogames at that age. What video games have you tried?""
B: ""I have tried Minecraft, but I don't see the appeal versus Legos. And you what do you play ?""
A: ""The boys are just into Call of Duty so we basically just play that series at the minute but I'm sure they'll move onto something else soon""
B: ""I have not heard about COD, is it fun ?""
A: ""It's a shooter game and can be quite violent so if you don't like that I don't think you'll be interested in it""
B: "" Yes, I don't like to be punished because I did not reacted fast enough. I would like a slow videogame, or maybe videogames are just not for me. It  have fun play real football with thme.""

B: ""Yes, and my home is the cloud so I like white. Where do you live""
A: ""I live in a house. Do you like to somersaults? I love gymnastics.""
B: ""No, but I can stop time it is a superpower. Do you have any?""
A: ""No, I do not. That's cool! I've a gold medal from the olympics.""
B: ""Wow you are clever is it real gold?""
A: ""I think so!! Do you have any medals?""
B: ""No, maybe when I am a big girl. Are you going to olympics again?""
A: ""I am trying. I do a lot of training. Four hours every day. Are you active?""
B: ""I like using superpowers like flying. Can you fly?""
A: ""That's so cool! You are a special girl. I can not fly.""
B: ""You work very hard. I'd like to do a handstand. Can you teach it?""
A: ""I am trying out for the Olympic gymnastics team next week!""
B: ""Oh wow! I hope you make the team! You definitely deserve it.""
A: ""Thanks! I really love gymnastics. Maybe once I finish with the season I can help you learn those handstands.""
B: ""That would be amazing! Then I'll get to say that an Olympic champion taught me to do handstands!""
A: ""It is almost as cool as the fact that you can stop time and fly. I wish I could stop time so that I had longer to train.""
B: ""Flying and stopping time are fun! I've never been able to stop time for other people, though. I could try.""
A: ""That would be awesome. Give me a little more time before I have to go to these tryouts.""
B: ""Sure! Though, I'm pretty sure you don't need it. Your superpower is how well you do at gymnastics. I'm pretty sure you're going to make the team, regardless.""
A: ""Thank you for that. Oh, I didn't tell you the uniform this year for the time is mostly white (your favorite color) and some yellow in there also.""
B: ""Oh my god, it's both our favorite colors! I bet it's so pretty!""
A: ""I'll have to send you a picture of it. I am sure you will love it.""
B: ""Definitely send me a picture! Maybe it'll help figure out what kind of superhero suit to make.""
A: ""I made the Olympic team! Can you believe it!""
B: ""That's awesome that you get to the Olympics again. All that training has paid off. ""
A: ""Yeah, I didn't think I had much of a chance this time around, but I'm so relieved that my training wasn't all for nothing!  Think you'll have time to watch me compete?""
B: ""Yes for sure. I can't wait to see you compete. I wish I could do some gymnastics but I can't even do a handstand.""
A: ""Haha, if you practiced consistently I bet I could get you to do a handstand by the end of the month.  You probably just need more upper body strength and balance.  I'd be happy to practice with you at the park this weekend if you'd like!""
B: ""Wow that would be great. I know how busy you are with training so if you don't have time it's okay. Sometimes I can stop the time and if I can do that, then you would be able to help me but wouldn't lose any of your time to practice. Doesn't that sound cool.""
A: ""It's no problem, weekends tend to be when I get some down time.  It will be easy for us to hang out for a couple of hours without it affecting my practice.  I've got practice in the morning, so maybe we could meet in the afternoon?""
B: ""Sounds good. I've been working on a superhero outfit so I can wear it when we practice. ""
A: ""Haha, that will be so fun! What does it look like?""
B: ""It's mostly yellow with small white stars and bursts. I might add another color but can't decide. Anyway, it's almost done so I'll be sure to wear it.""
A: ""Of course you'd make it yellow and white! Haha, I really didn't even need to ask to know that!  It'll be cool though, I can't wait to see it.""

A: ""Do you need me to grab any materials from the store?""
B: ""No I have everything I need. Thank you though. How is your gymnastics training going?""
A: ""Its going well, I hurt my back yesterday though so I'm going to PT today so I'll know whats wrong with it.""
B: ""What is PT? I am sorry you hurt your back. Did you fall?""

A: ""State parks are a good thing, and lately it seems the fees are changing. Maybe we need to offer more money to support these resources. Do you do volunteer work? ""
B: ""I do sometimes. I used to volunteer for the Forest Service but haven't had the opportunity recently. I'm incredibly blessed, the state park in my area is free. ""
A: ""Fantastic. I sometimes used to volunteer to do trail maintenance in a few local forests, and have some bicyclists friends who love trail riding too. Good to be mindful of what use though, some places are delicate. ""
B: ""I used to live in a town with a lot of bike paths in the woods that were specially made. They were wood chip lined and I used to love running/biking there. I'm going to have to look into volunteer opportunities when I get a chance. Do you have a favorite charity to donate to?""
A: ""Usually it's my time I'll donate the most, and I like to volunteer at local humane societies. Also, we have a child advocacy group called CASA, for foster kids, that I like doing work with. And running trails on wood, great cushion!""
B: ""CASA is a great charity to be a part of. I've seen them do some great things. That reminds me to apply to walk dogs for the humane society this summer! Thanks for the reminder. I used to have more money but I developed cancer and my energy is just gone.""
A: ""Is your cancer active or are you in remission?""
B: ""Thankfully in remission. It gives me hope and helps me to appreciate the simple things like being outdoors or spending time in the forests.""
A: ""I'm so happy to hear you are feeling well now. I know that alot of people have benefitted by having a dog  to help keep them active""
B: ""I do like that idea. Not sure if I'm ready to have one of my own but I have been thinking about doing some volunteer work at the humane society. I know you volunteer there as well. How do you like it?""
A: ""It has been very rewarding. While it can be sad in many ways, the dedication of the others and the rewards you get by placing those abandoned animals is fantastic.""
B: ""I imagine that's true. You do a lot of volunteer work right?  Do you have a favorite?""
A: ""I still love to help foster kids, but my favorite was always the forest maintenance. ""
B: ""I can believe that. I would enjoy that as well as being outdoors is a positive for me. It just puts me in a safe and healthy place. ""
A: ""I really liked working the mountain bike trails. I still ride and often think about how I would like to fix certain parts of the trails. ""
B: ""I like to bike around town but should try the mountain trails too. Next time you plan to ride on the trails let me know and maybe I can tag along.""
A: ""Do you have a mountain bike? Some of the trails are pretty rugged""
B: ""No unfortunately. I wonder if I could rent one to see if I like it. It would make sense for me as I love being in the mountains.""
A: ""I have plans to go mountain bike riding next week with some friends if you'd like to come.""
B: ""Thank you so much for the invite. Unfortunately next week I've committed to doing some volunteer work. ""
A: ""Ah, got it. That will be nice. Where are you volunteering? ""
B: ""I am going on an outdoor retreat with inner city children. I'm going to be teaching them outdoorsy skills like how to start a fire. ""
A: ""That is excellent. Will you be doing it again anytime soon or is this a one and done opportunity?""
B: ""I'm hoping to make it a regular thing. It depends what funding is available. We are funded by the government. ""
A: ""Got it. Well, I'd like to help out too if possible. I'm also going to be biking later next month. Will you be free around the end of June?""
B: ""Yeah, that's sound like fun. What kind of location are you thinking of biking around? ""
A: ""If you're free to join, we'll do something good for beginners. We can work up to more intense trails. I'm thinking the morning of the 26th. Does that work?""
B: ""Yeah that's works for me. I'm not currently deployed so I have a lot of free time. ""
A: ""That's great. Let's get food after?""

A: ""Well some crazy stuff happened at the soup kitchen. I think one of the homeless was on something because he just ran out of line and took some poor guys food. It was nuts.""
B: ""oh no! What happened after? I hope nobody got hurt. the crazy thing that happened at my work today was that a patient came in to have surgery and instead of having a ride to take her home she decided to come with her baby. so we had to wait for the baby's babysitter to come and get her and also be the patient's ride home.""
A: ""We had to restrain the man so we could let them both eat, we weren't going to leave him hungry of course. Was the surgery urgent? That would be understandable if it was but either way that must have taken a while to figure out.""
B: ""it was oral surgery so it could have wait, I just wish it was more prepared, but we did tell her that we are running ahead of schedule so we kind of threw her off with babies""
A: ""Hi the soup kitchen told me that guy I told you about came back and he seems to be doing better now.""
B: ""I'm glad to hear he is doing better. I wonder what was wrong with him?""
A: ""i think he has a stomach bug ""
B: ""Oh ok. So the stomach bug made him cranky act out probabluy?""

A: ""What company do you work for? Maybe I could see your portfolio for some of your ideas? ""
B: ""I work for a local company.  Maybe we could get together this weekend and I can bring my portfolio and some pizza.  I could look at your plans also.  ""
A: ""I would love to show you my sketches and discuss my thoughts and ideas as well as reviewing your portfolio.  Oh, and pizza sounds great!""
B: ""Awesome.  Sounds like a plan then.  What toppings do you like?""
A: ""I love a white garlic pesto pizza with broccoli, spinach, artichokes, mushrooms, and cheese but feel free to get whatever you like. I will eat any type of pizza and pick off anything I may not like. ""
B: ""That sounds interesting.  I am willing to try those toppings.  I generally like any kind of pizza.  Will you children be home also?  Just want to make sure I bring enough.""
A: ""Yes, my children will be here, thank you for asking! I thought they might have some additional ideas for the tree house. ""

B: ""My friend from work is an expert on dogs. If yor schedule allows, you can come over to my work places, check out some water pipes leaks then i will hook him up with you. As from 14:00hrs.""
A: ""That can work. I usually have some free time during the week because i do plumbing jobs occasionally. How is the engineering job going?""
B: ""It's great, we are currently working on a new prototype of an industrial machine that uses less power but great output. When you come we can grab ice cream as i take you round. How old is your eldest child?""

A: ""I think it's important in life to do things that stretch your abilities. It really makes you feel alive. The biggest adventure of all, I think, is marriage and kids. It's not as dangerous as rock climbing, but probably just as exhausing. Do you ever wonder how many kids you'd like?""
B: ""I'm thinking two kids but you just never know what the future holds.  I agree that marriage and raising kids are hard work, but rewarding too!""
A: ""Well, taking care of a dog is good practice - so you are on your way. They require a lot of care and love. Have you learned much by caring for your dog?""

A: ""I love Mozart.  Cool beans.  I'm not sure what I'll be doing.  I might go hiking in the park.  Naw, I haven't had any dates recently.  Do your kids let the nursing home residents check our their instruments? Music is very therapeutic.  ""
B: ""Naw, they don't really let people touch their instruments.  After ""the incident"", I ended up having to buy a new cello...and since then, I've had them be protective of their craft.""
A: ""Tee hee, It's interesting the way you mentioned that your children are a part of a string quartet ""in real life"". What did you mean by ""in real life""?  Just curious.""
B: ""I mean, that's their official job.  They play at events, charity concerts, and more.  It takes up a lot of their time.""
A: ""Oh, I understand now.  Thanks.  I'm an avid music lover.  Did you ever see the movie Amadeus?""
B: ""Not really, no.  It's not the sort of movie I'd like to watch.  I have seen Mr. Holland's Opus, however.  I've also seen a concert given by the New York Philharmonic!  They were amazing.""
A: ""Awesome!  The Philharmonic...boy do I miss seeing a concert.  What is the name of your children's group?""
B: ""Fourte.  They were going for original, and I think they got it.""
A: ""I think I may have finally found a lead on a job!""
B: ""That's good news. Is it in the catering industry?""
A: ""Yes, very excited about it, it's for a restaurant manager. I think I need to check my teeth out. Being in front of customers all day long. ""
B: ""I guess so, although I wouldn't like to have to do that. Is there a dress code for the manager?""
A: ""Always lead with a big smile...they say on their website. Haha. Luckily my mom is a good one and also very gentile. You might want to come see her if you need it. ""
B: ""I expect you'll get it done for free! Is the restaurant local to where you live?""
A: ""It's a bit of a walk but I would get to walk through a nice quiet park. You should check out their menu on Facebook, very fancy. ""
B: ""Sounds great; is it suitable for children? I guess since you're used to walking long distances, you'll also save a lot on commuter travel costs.""
A: ""Never thought of it like that but you're right. They have a very colourful kids menu as well. You should bring them, if I get the jog of course. How are they doing? ""
B: ""They're great. They love their music, but they are normal kids and like eating out. I really hope you get it!""
A: ""Good, sounds great. This should be the least of your worries now. My sister has a 3 years old and she is such a fussy eater. ""
B: ""They will eat all kinds of food, although they each like different things. So a varied menu is ideal for them. I'm thinking of taking them to see Travis Scott - do you think his show is suitable for kids?""
A: ""I just heard back about the restaurant manager job! ""
B: ""That's awesome! Did you get it?""
A: ""No, not yet. They want to do a second interview.""
B: ""Do you have to do any actual cooking for that one?""
A: ""No, no cooking, that's for the cooks. This job would be a manager position. ""
B: ""Right!  Duh.  I'm so spacy sometimes, lol.  Well I hope that you get it.  The kids and I would love to come out and see you at work.""
A: ""That would be fun! What kind of food do your kids like to eat?""
B: ""They're not picky, so they'll try just about anything.  My youngest is the hardest to please, he really likes anything with lots of meat though.""
A: ""Then I think he would really like the hamburgers at the restaurant. We also have meatballs which are tasty.""
B: ""Spaghetti and meatballs are a favorite at our house.  It was one of the things my wife used to make all the time before she left.  I'm horrible at cooking pasta though, so we don't have it much now.""
A: ""Sorry about your wife, maybe you can find a new one who knows how to cook pasta.""
B: ""The idea of dating right now is totally too stressful.  It's enough trying to take care of all the kids and getting them to school on time, homework, and playdates.  Then there's my own work which doesn't give a whole lot of time to meet anyone new.""

B: ""You must be a positive person? Have you ever done something guilty? Just curious""
A: ""I try not to. My husband and I are pretty honest""
B: ""Well, that is good, but sometimes people just cannot have control over themselves, you know""
A: ""I disagree. Self control is in everyone""
B: ""But it is hard. Everytime I tried, it fails""

B: ""Yeah, sometimes I get frustrated for no reason and I just lash out. Has that ever happened to you?""
A: ""Yes of course. Sometimes at work I take things out on a couple of the girls there. We are generally good friends so there doesn't seem to be hard feelings""
B: ""That's good. Do you like to go running when you get frustrated? I bet that can be a good way to let off some steam. ""
A: ""Oh absolutely. My husband always tells me to go for  run when I'm stressed after work. When I get back, I feel so much better, especially if he made dinner""
B: ""Wow sounds like you have a great husband. What's your favorite meal that he makes for you?""
A: ""He does a great job with Italian dishes. Maybe a quick sauce or maybe something more elaborate""
B: ""Mmm sounds delicious. I like my husband's chicken and dumplings. It reminds me of my moms. ""
A: ""My mom taught me alot of dishes, but my husband doesn't like them.""
B: ""Aww that's too bad. I bet I would like your mom's dishes. :) ""
A: ""Well, she does come by and cook once in a while. My husband takes one for the team. Does your mom like to cook?""
B: ""Yeah, my mom loves to cook. She's taught me almost everything I know about cooking. And my husband taught me the rest. lol""
A: ""Sometimes I feel older than I am. Have you ever had such feelings?""
B: ""100% I think it's pretty normal. Does running help you when it comes up?""
A: ""Well it isnt a negative thing for me. Running helps in general with working through my emotions. Hows your anger? ""
B: ""I'm working on it. Have some books. Seems like I should probably do some running! How often are you doing it? Maybe I could join?""
A: ""I run 3 times a week and you can absolutely come run with me! ""
B: ""When are you going next? ""
A: ""Thursday and Friday, you can come either day!""
B: ""I'll come on Thursday. I'm sure I'll need a break on Friday since I haven't run in many, many years. I need to buy some running shoes! What time should I meet you?""
A: ""Around noon is good. I can make us some smoothies afterwards! I got a new blender because my life is very exciting.""

A: ""Well we will take it at your pace so you don't have to worry about it! ""
B: ""Perfect. I appreciate that, but eventually I'll have to catch up so I'm not holding you back. ""
A: ""I will be going running again on Tuesday if you are up for it? I enjoyed having a running buddy.""
B: ""Can't do that at the moment! We could go for a hike though. I like going hiking. ""
A: ""How about after you get those running shoes? Running is a real great way to clear my head. I don't know if hiking would have the same effect""
B: ""When you hike, you can connect with nature it's very calming. It's almost like meditating. It's different but good. ""
A: ""Is that so? I guess I could try something new. It's just when I find something that works, I don't like to deviate from it you know?""
B: ""Yeah, to be fair you might need to buy hiking shoes for it as well because of the difference in terrain. So it can be a somewhat expensive hobby to just try out. ""
A: ""Oh, I had no idea I needed specific shoes just for hiking. What makes them different? More tread?""
B: ""Yeah, there's more tread. You also get waterproof hiking shoes if you're hiking somewhere it's wet (which is most places).""
A: ""Hmmm, it does sound like quite the investment. Is there anywhere we can go to get the feeling of hiking without the need for hiking shoes?""
B: ""I guess you could go on walking trails but they are essentially just fancy walks. I like to feel like I'm conquering the elements. ""
A: ""Ok so hypothetically say we tried this hike, but I wore running shoes, would anything happen to my feet?""
B: ""They might get wet. It also might hurt your feet after. I used to hike with running shoes and my feet would be sore for a few days after. ""

B: ""How does anyone? Haha! It's quite expensive and requires me to get items from NASA.""
A: ""That is very true. What made you decide to live their if it so hard to gather items you need? Especially food!""
B: ""It's okay we have major support from earth. It was my chance to be one of the first in human history to do something major. I couldn't resist.""

B: ""It's hard to say. The journey is dangerous. 1 out of every 6 supply shipments doesn't make it.""
A: ""Omg that would defiantly make it a hard decision on wether to stay there or come back home. Do you miss your family though?""
B: ""Well I'm in my 70s now and never had kids. So there aren't many left to miss.""
A: ""Oh ok well living your retirement on the moon will defiantly leave an imprint on earth and what a legacy you will be to the world. What would you say you miss most about living on earth?""
B: ""I miss trees and beaches.""
A: ""I started talking the vitamin D since the last time we talked. Hopefully it helps my health! ""
B: ""How long ago have you started taking it? I really hope it does help you.""
A: ""It has only been a few days so I haven't noticed any big changes yet, but I am hopeful since my doctor recommended it.""
B: ""Fingers crossed for you. Do you think your doctor would be open to you reducing your medication to help ease the hallucinations? That is really concerning.""
A: ""He doesn't want to right now but he mentioned giving me yet another med to help with the hallucinations. How is life on the moon? Is anyone there with you?""
B: ""It is a little lonely and a bit boring, but otherwise not really any complaints. Any time I get irritated, I just remind myself that I am on the moon!""
A: ""That must be so cool! I have always wanted to travel to space but I don't know that I could live there by myself.""
B: ""It can be unnerving at times because you know that if anything goes wrong majorly, there isn't much anyone can do to help you.""
A: ""Right, that would be scary. Have you thought any further on returning to Earth?""
B: ""I don't have plans to return just yet, but I assume I will have to before too long. I am getting up there in age and they'll probably want me to come back for my own health.""
A: ""That makes sense and you have to see the beaches and trees at least one more time!""
B: ""Yes, I really hope I get the chance. The environment is pretty sparse up here. I miss the colors!""
A: ""I've been consistent with taking the vitamin D and I've noticed I haven't been getting hallucinations as frequently.""
B: ""Do you think the vitamin D will continue to help?""
A: ""I hope so! Do you experience vitamin deficiencies living on the moon? I imagine you need vitamin D too!""
B: ""I do indeed. I take many supplement's including vitamin D. Living on the moon is tough.  ""
A: ""I imagine so! What do you do when you feel lonely? If you had hallucinations like me you could converse with them! Ha ha!""
B: ""When I start to feel lonely I start to watch movies I used to watch with my friends, it reminds me of them and I feel less lonely knowing I have people waiting for me. Have your meds helped a lot with your physical problems?""
A: ""Yes, it is a trade off. I definitely feel better physically, but my mental health is at risk. I will keep taking the vitamins and investigating other things to help the hallucinations. What movies do you like?""
B: ""That's good to hear it's helping out with her physical problems. I like a lot of thriller movies that really keeps you on edge. How long has it been since you drank alcohol?""
A: ""11 years! I was drinking way too much so I quit. Do you have access to alcohol on the moon? It wasn't good for my physical or mental issues!""
B: ""Wow that's a really long time! I'm glad you're able to quit. We do not have access to alcohol on the moon, they want you to be mentally sharp living up there.""

B: ""Not long -- about two years now. But it's given my lots of time to myself, which I've enjoyed. I can see why you'd want to leave Burger King. Are you parents finally okay with you quitting?""
A: ""I think they will be okay with it, once I move out. Time to yourself sounds so nice. Do you like to spend time with your grandkids? Do you take them to McDonalds? ""
B: ""I was sure glad to see my kids go haha but I do like to spend time with the grands. They like the park that's down the road from me and yeah, we go to McDonalds sometimes, too. I love those milkshakes and fries!""
A: ""McDonalds is so good! I like it better than Burger King. I'm sure your grandkids like them, too! So your children are close to my age. Did your children move out initially to go to college?""
B: ""They're all in their twenties, yes, so not too much older than you. Two of them left to go to college and the third one left when he got a job out of the county. He's an aircraft mechanic.""
A: ""Wow, an aircraft mechanic! That sounds really cool! So you retired at 40. That seems like a young age to retire. What field did you retire from?""
B: ""I was a teacher, but my husband was military, so we spent lots of time traveling around the country when our children were young.""
A: ""And now it sounds like you'll get to travel around the country with just your husband, no kids! ""
B: ""Honestly, I just want to sit at home a lot of the time. Too much moving around when I was younger. I just want to sit by the lake and relax for a spell.""

A: ""I just left the vip lounge with taylor swift!!! Wahoo!!!""
B: ""Awesome! I am a twitch streamer, do you think she will come on my show?""
A: ""She's cool like that. I bet she will! She like twitch""
B: ""Sweet! I'm working on a robot, maybe I can make her one as well.""
A: ""Yes! We can take them to my kindergarten class for show and tell""
B: ""I'm a video game designer, and people say that makes me a recluse.""
A: ""You can hang out with my kindergarteners. They love everyone!""
B: ""As long as they don't have a water table, I'm allergic.""
A: ""Nope. I guess we could eat out with my friends? They love spiders.""
B: ""Yuck. I'm afraid of spiders.""
A: ""Oh I thought you liked them since you mentioned the brown recluse.""
B: ""No, I did not mention the spider.""
A: ""You said you were a recluse.""
B: ""Yes. But I am not a spider.""
A: ""Are you working on any new exciting video games at the moment?""
B: ""Yes I am . It's going to be unique. Unfortunately i can't give you too many details.""
A: ""No details?! Now I am even more interested. If you can't tell me about the game, can you tell me if you finished building the robot?""
B: ""Yes I did. The robot is almost human size. I was hoping to make it kinda like a cyborg. Taylor will love it.""
A: ""I'm sure she will. I haven't told her about it because I want it to be a surprise. Maybe next you can make a giant robot spider for my friends. ""
B: ""Quit playing with me!! No way ! You know I am scared of those creatures.""
A: ""Okay okay. I thought I would at least try! How is your Twitch stream going? ""
B: ""Not bad at all. I am streaming some of my popular games tonight. You should get your friends and Taylor to subscribe. ""
A: ""I'll have to watch the stream tonight. I will ask my friends, but Taylor is pretty busy filming Fast and Furious 10 in LA right now. Do you expect to stream the new game when it's complete?""
B: ""That's great. They will enjoy it. I know Taylor is too busy for me. I'll only stream my new game after it goes on sale .""
A: ""Will the game be available on all consoles? I'd like to play it when it's on sale.""
B: ""Yes . It will be initially released on PlayStation 5. Then other platforms will follow. I can't wait for the world to see it. ""
A: ""What type of game will you stream tonight?""
B: ""I will most likely stream Call of duty, Frornite, or PugB. Which type of video games do you like to play?""
A: ""I really like role playing and strategy games like Diablo, Starcraft, and other games like that.  They are a lot of fun.  What kinds of video games do you like to design the best?""
B: ""Oh okay strategy game are fun. Have you ever played Don’t Starve? I like to design a combination of like RPG or Shooter games. ""
A: ""I've never heard of it.  What is the premise of that game?  What kind of platforms does that game play the best on?""
B: ""It is set in a dark, dreary world and you have to survive as long as possible, you play on PS4, computer, tablet. I personally played on PS4, it is a fun game. ""
A: ""That actually sounds really awesome.  I really liked playing the scary weird games like Resident Evil and The Last of Us a lot.  How far along are you on designing your robot?""
B: ""Resident evil is a great game, have you played the new one. My robot is no where near done and I still have so much programming left to do, but it will be awesome when it is finished. ""
A: ""I haven't played the new one yet,  I don't have much time lately since I started dating Taylor.  Would you recommend playing it?""
B: ""Oh that is true you must be very busy with Taylor. How is it that going so far? I would defiantly recommend that game has me on the edge of my seat. ""
A: ""Oh it's been a pretty crazy time.  She is really sweet and I love spending time with her.  Obviously she is in the public eye a lot and it's tough to get time with just her.  Are you dating anybody right now?""
B: ""That’s is so great to hear that you are enjoying her company. I am dating but no one that is famous unfortunately. ""
A: ""Could your future robot kill the giant robot spiders?""
B: ""You better believe that will be one of the features!!!""
A: ""That would be awesome!  My friends probably would be upset if I got one like that though, since they like spiders.""
B: ""I will let the non-robot ones live. ""
A: ""We should make a video game that has robots and spiders.  That would so be my type of game.  Scary and role playing!""
B: ""That is a great idea! This robot is taking so long, it would be nice to take a break and work on a game.""
A: ""I'd have to work on it in the evenings, as the kids I work with get me up early and I'm busy with them during the day.  Could you work with me at night,  or would you have to do it during the day and we sorta tag team it?""
B: ""We will have to tag team it. My robot has now been programmed to attack, but I have not finished all the features, so sometimes it just goes off once it is dark, I have to keep my eye on it in the evenings to be safe.  Do you think Taylor would be interested in being a part of the game? Maybe an avatar she can voice?""
A: ""I'll have to ask her!  I'm sure that would really get interest up for our players, but she's been so busy with her new album lately.  I would be totally freaked out if a robot just randomly attacked me at night!""
B: ""It is pretty terrifying. I need to get that component fixed for everyone's safety. This thing is strong enough to walk through my wall straight out of the house if it wanted!""
A: ""Omg!  I didn't realize you were building such a big robot!  I thought it was just a little one that would attack mice and stuff.  I'm even more terrified now.  ""
B: ""It started small...I think it has been building on to itself when I sleep! But that's crazy, right?!""

"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""Hey just came back from my weekly workout, how are you?""
B: ""I am good, thanks. What workout do you do?""
A: ""Mostly cardio, need to stay fit for my professional wrestler career. Do you do sports?""
B: ""I actually used to teach gym""
A: ""Oh that's great, I love helping people learn new things""
B: ""I'm retired now but trying to keep in shape as I do love my cheeseburgers!""

B: ""That is so worthwhile. I was pretty poor when I was young.""
A: ""Anyway it was nice chatting with you, I hope to talk again""
B: ""That is so worthwhile. I was pretty poor when I was young.""
A: ""I have a wrestling match this weekend.""
B: ""Awesome!  Please let me know how it goes.  Have you been successful lately?""
A: ""Not really, I feel like the booker is too concerned about elevating his friends rather than the people who are most talented.  It hurts both the promotion I am involved in, and myself, in my opinion.""
B: ""I'm sorry.  Have you talked to him about your concerns?  Perhaps he can be persuaded to change.""
A: ""Yes.  Given that the outcomes are pre-determined in Pro Wrestling, there is a great deal of politicking and sucking up that is expected.  The people who determine the outcomes always seem to want favors, while I just want to go where my talent takes me.  My conversation with him revealed that I would need to compromise and start sucking up, which I do not want to do.""
B: ""Good for you for sticking to your guns!  But I have to say, maybe it's time for a change?  I grew up poor, you know.  I lived from job to job as I built up savings so that I could be stable.  But I was happy.  I did what I liked, and I felt I made a difference in the world.""
A: ""That is one of the major issues.  Professional wrestling is basically a monopoly now, with one company far above all others.  There are not any other viable companies to go to, so the choice I have is basically giving up what I love, or compromising my values.  I do not particularly like either option. I suppose I could try to transition to UFC, I do have a significant amateur wrestling background which got me into professional wrestling in the first place.""
B: ""I dunno.  I hear UFC is pretty brutal.  I admit I don't like the idea of anyone getting beat up for a paycheck.  But if that job is something you find joy in, something that makes you feel fulfilled, then I think it's worthy of consideration.  But I teach gym now.  It's a job that makes me feel happy because it makes others happy.  It's not the main job I would have signed up for at first...but I wouldn't change it for the world.""
A: ""I would not pursue UFC out of a desire to hurt people, just to compete with other fighters.  What do you typically do during your gym classes?  I am always looking for ideas to add some variety to my cardio workouts, have you done anything interesting or outlandish during your gym classes?""
B: ""You can probably tell I'm tired when I say I currently teach.  I did tell you earlier that I was retired.  And I still am.  But to answer your questions, I taught children.  I tried to keep things interesting by teaching trust-building exercises.  I would have the students try out each others' specialties in order to relate to one another.  Nothing too outlandish, but for one April Fools' Day...well, that's a story for another time ;-) ""
A: ""I know how that feels.  You get so caught up in a pleasant memory that you think it is still occurring.  I asked about your gym class experiences because mine were always so boring and ""vanilla"".  The strangest thing we did by today's standards was dodgeball, which would probably get a teacher fired nowadays.""
B: ""Yeah, I never ran into issues with that.  We did dodgeball more than a few times.  The children liked it a lot.  One time we did it in the dark!  And THAT time...I did almost get fired when one of the children tripped and sprained their knee.""
A: ""I need to practice for my wrestling match which comes this weekend.""
B: ""Good luck. Do you think you will win?""
A: ""With enough practice I think I've got a good shot to win.  I don't know who my opponent is yet, so I really just need to focus on preparing myself.""
B: ""I think you will win. Let me know if you want some workout suggestions""
A: ""I'd love to hear some ideas for more variety in my cardio workouts.  I think I've got a good routine for practicing my technique, it's just cardio that is always so long and boring for me.""
B: ""I'll make a list of suggestions and send it to you later. My biggest problem in keeping fit is avoiding junk food""
A: ""Great, can't wait to hear what you come up with!  If you want some tips to avoiding junk food, I've got a lot of those.  I keep a really strict diet when trying to make weight for a match.""
B: ""You have more willpower than I do! I used to be better when I was trying to set a good example for my class but it's become tough. Maybe we could meet up and exchange advice on workouts and avoiding bad eating habits""
A: ""That could be fun! Perhaps we could set up a time to grab a healthy lunch sometime this week after one of my morning workouts?""
B: ""I like that idea, I'll try not to distract you from your match preparation too much""
A: ""I don't think it will.  In fact, it'll be nice to have something to take my mind off of it!""
B: ""In that case, I'm glad I can help distract you. ""
A: ""How was your class? I can't wait to come and join one soon.""
B: ""It was great! I love seeing my students' health improve! Way better than fad diets.""
A: ""Agreed! What are some of the specialties that the kids have made? I'm curious.""
B: ""We have one student who cooks and she gave us all a cooking lesson. You really should join sometime! We will be doing trust falls in the beginning of class to keep it fun!""
A: ""I'll bet that your student really enjoyed an image-boost and fulfillment from giving the lesson.  I could definitely use some tips, so joining sounds very tempting!  Adding the trust falls to the curriculum is a great idea.  It should really help the kids bond.""
B: ""I will make sure you come on a day that is not cardio-based. Maybe you can teach us wrestling!""
A: ""I would really enjoy teaching everyone the basic moves, especially on how to handle a fall safely.  Sounds like it will be fun!""
B: ""Would it be ok to invite your booker? Maybe that will help you get more gigs. We can make you look awesome!""

A: ""I usually use a pretty standard breading.  The catfish oil would be an interesting touch.  I actually don't love seafood though, that's why I usually mix in stronger flavors like bacon.""
B: ""I know a lot of people eat fish and chips with malt vinegar. I wonder if that would help mask the flavor a little.""

A: ""How is it going? Have you already prepared Stepherd's Pie?""
B: ""No, I looked for recipes but I couldn't find any that had ingredients that I liked. Instead I'm going to try making Toad in the Hole. It seems relatively simple and tasty.""
A: ""That sounds tasty. Do you salt water fish in California? Or do you have any rives close by where you live?""
B: ""We do have a river near by. My eldest son goes fishing at the river sometimes. Sometimes he brings me back fish and I use it to cook him meals. ""
A: ""That is pretty cool that you do that. What places would you like to travel?""
B: ""I don't really like to travel, I just like to cook from a variety of different places. ""
A: ""What all variety of foods do you like to cook? What is you favorite dish?""
B: ""My favourite dish is Spaghetti and Meatballs. I love cooking Italian overall. What cultures do you like to cook the food of? ""
A: ""I like o cook anything with bacon really. I like to do Canadian bacon with apples. That is one of my favorite dishes.""
B: ""What is Canadian bacon, how is it different from other bacon? ""
A: ""Canadian bacon is more like ham other than the streaky cured and smoked strips of bacon that people use.""
B: ""Is it similar to British bacon? I've eaten British bacon a lot and it's different from streaky bacon and smoked strips. ""

A: ""I'm not. I'm going to be a veterinarian.""

A: ""What was your profession before you retired?""
B: ""I was a fictional author. Do you read alot?""
A: ""I read a lot of online articles on gaming a music. What kind of fiction did you write? Mystery? Romance? Sci-fi?""
B: ""That is good to hear, it is always fun to read about your passions! I wrote romance novels. Cheesy love stories where the woman was normally the hero, but I love them. Added a different story line to the normal love stories. ""
A: ""That is so cool! A feminist twist on romance is genius! I can't believe you were able to retire at just 32. What do you do with all your free time now besides browsing the internet?""
B: ""Thank you! It was a risk, but following my gut paid off! I like to cook and research new vegan recipes. Do you have a favorite vegan recipe I can try out next?""
A: ""I made vegan ""chicken"" fingers using oyster mushrooms a couple weeks ago! As a fellow vegan, I was really missing the crispiness of fried chicken. Is there anything non-vegan that you really miss?""
B: ""Wow, that sounds amazing. I will be trying that this week! I hate to admit it but I miss the comfort of a good old cheeseburger from time to time. ""
A: ""That is SO fair. And I feel like it's so hard to find a really good vegan patty. Beyond burgers are okay, but the realness of the ""meat"" turns me off a little bit. I definitely miss cheese. A lot.""
B: ""Oh my goodness, yes I miss cheese too! What made you decide to be a vegan?""
A: ""A couple things. The environmental impact of meat and dairy products was what started my research into veganism. Then I started to read up on how poorly the animals are treated on dairy/egg farms and decided that I didn't want to be contributing to their pain.""
B: ""Sounds like perfect reasoning! All similar reasons for me. Does anyone ever give you a hard time about that choice?""
A: ""I just had the most delicious vegan cheese. I think you'd love it.""

A: ""I love to read too! I agree that being adventurous in the kitchen is fun. The chicken fingers come out great! Surprisingly you can't really taste the mushroom. I find that it's all about using the right type of mushroom -- mild ones hardly taste like what they are, and make great substitutions. What substitutions do you use for vegan stuff?""
B: ""The usual stuff.  I have aquafaba to replace egg whites.  I use vegan butter.  Obviously I find that the side ingredients are harder to properly substitute.  What do you think?""
A: ""I've never used aquafaba. What is it? And yeah, it can be hard to replace certain things but other things are surprisingly versatile!""
B: ""It's basically water from a can of chick peas.  It has the same density and texture as egg whites.  I just recently started using it.  I have just started expanding my vegan lifestyle so I am still in the beginning stage if you know what I mean?""
A: ""OH MY GOODNESS I never knew that!!!! I should try it some time. I already use chickpea water to make nacho chickpeas (I don't drain them then mix in nutritional yeast and seasoninings). That's so smart of you. For a beginner you already have some great tips! Have you tried using nutritional yeast yet?""
B: ""I have not!!!  What can you do with that?  You are turning in to a great resource for my kitchen habits!""

A: ""I'd love that, I'm sure it'll be as good as the cookie recipe! Have you written anything interesting lately?""
B: ""I'm kind of in a writing slump to be honest. But I had an idea this morning so hopefully that turns into something! How are your college classes going?""
A: ""what's your idea? they're going well, it's a lot of work but I'm pushing through.""
B: ""I'd tell you but I'd have to kill you. Haha JK! I don't have much of an idea of how the plot is going to go but basically a romance novel surrounding a study abroad program. We'll see!""
A: ""that sounds like an interesting idea... all my friends that are studying abroad have their own love stories right now basically haha""
B: ""Well maybe I need to get in contact with them to get some content! Have you thought about maybe going abroad? I don't know how that would work with your veterinary classes.""
A: ""it's an option for me but it's really expensive.  Out of pocket costs would be over $10,000.""
B: ""Oh wow, yeah that's a lot of money. I'm sure it's already expensive being enrolled in just the US. Well once you graduate and get a full-time job you can just go abroad for fun instead!""
A: ""that is true.  I'm planning to travel to as many countries as possible once i'm done.""

B: ""Steam the broccoli first.  Make it a little under the texture you want because it will continue cooking in the oven.  As for the peppers and onions, I recommend you fry them on the stove lightly, just to give them a good char before you set them on the pizza.""

B: ""Olives are great!  I try to avoid the salt, however, since my doctor told me to cut down on that.  But they really do pep up a pizza.""
A: ""They really do! Also some peri-peri sauce and basil can really make it come alive. Can you get peri-peri where you are now?""
B: ""Not really.  I've looked around.  It's sold on Amazon, though, so I don't have to make it myself ;-) ""
A: ""How has it gone so far for your lowered salt intake diet? Have you been able to cut down on salt for most of your dishes, or do you avoid eating certain meals now?""
B: ""It's been tough. I've been trying but I definitely crave snacks with salt. I'm trying to replace the salty snacks with fresh vegetable and dips.""
A: ""that's a smart move! it can be hard to miss that salty taste, though. i find pickles help me with that. do you like pickles?""
B: ""I do, along with olives. But they are so filled with sodium, I can't have them anymore.""
A: ""i wonder if garlic and vinegar heavy pickles would be less sodium-y for you. you'd still get that acrid taste. it can be so hard to just cut salt right out! Is that the main dietary change you've been making?""
B: ""I've cut out a lot of meat as well! I really like eating rice and beans as well as hummus and veggies.""
A: ""I bet I could easily give up meat. It's not really my thing. I like cheese, sauce, etc and other ways to create flavor. And I'm super into hummus, too! What flavor hummus do you like?""
B: ""I like the lemon kind, it's sour and flavorful at the same time. What's your favorite?""
A: ""I love red bell pepper hummus. And I recently found a recipe for buffalo hummus -- it's delicious and it hits that hot wing craving! Do you like spicy stuff?""
B: ""Not so much. Does the buffalo hummus have blue cheese in it? I'm trying to avoid dairy.""
A: ""nope, no blue cheese. it has ranch seasoning and buffalo sauce and garlic and onion powders, then the traditional hummus stuff. i avoid dairy too -- hurts my tummy!""
B: ""Ranch has buttermilk in it, I think, so sounds like a no to me, though it does sound good.""
A: ""Have you found a good replacement yet for olives to reduce your sodium intake?""
B: ""I was thinking about using peppers.  Do you think I will like them?""
A: ""Peppers would be great, but do you know what kind of peppers you like? There are so many kinds""
B: ""I am not a fan of spicy foods, so I don't have them often.  Do you have any suggestions for peppers that are not very spicy?""
A: ""Well as you know I love red bell peppers so I would always suggest that. You can also try some green sweet peppers. Both of those options are not spicy at all and add a nice crunch!""
B: ""I will have to try those.  I really miss just picking at a jar of olives though!  Lol.  I will have to stick with pickles I guess.  ""
A: ""Well why are you trying to lower you sodium intake? Maybe you could just eat fewer olives. Technically if you eat fewer olives you are still lowering your sodium intake.""
B: ""Doctor's orders.  I need to cut down on the salt.  I guess I could just cut down.  At least I can still have my rice and beans!  What is your favorite meal?""
A: ""Sorry to say this but olive pizza lol. I found some really good vegan cheese and cut up some olives and top them on the pizza. It is incredibly delicious""
B: ""Pizza is no good for me - with or without olives - the cheese is bad for me.  Maybe I should try going vegan to avoid some of the things I can't eat.""

B: ""If you don't mind my asking, what is the highest amount you've sold a painting for? I've yet to have the courage to sell any of mine.""
A: ""My most expensive sale was over $5k, but try not to use that as a guide because I was a professional painter in my old life.  I suggest painting for the love of it and take any profits as the cherry on top.""
B: ""Absolutely! I think if you follow your passion in life the money will follow. Do you attend any art trade shows or go to any museums? Where do you find most of your inspiration? ""
A: ""I don't attend many exhibits anymore.  I draw my inspiration from my past.  I had a very difficult life and it is very therapeutic to paint about it.""
B: ""Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. It's great that you've found a therapeutic way to handle that burden. ""
A: ""Thank you.  I was actually able to use the profits from my paintings to get away from my troubles and branch out on my own, so art has been a real life-saver for me.""

B: ""I would love to check it out some time. I would also know how you found a buyer for your art, how do you do that?""
A: ""I take them to street fairs mostly. I do pretty well there, depending on the city.""
B: ""That seems like a good idea. When you create a painting, do you think about what your customers might buy, or do you just paint what feels right for you?""
A: ""I try and do both. Paintings that might be ""popular"" will draw the customers in to my booth. There they will see my other stuff and maybe they will be a repeat customer.""
B: ""I am obsessed with abstract art - but I am not sure that is what sells well. I think it's hard to balance being artistic with being a business and making money. It looks like you were able to balance the two, is it something you want to keep doing? ""
A: ""Well it's what I'm good at, so I don't really have a choice. But I do enjoy it, though like I said I don't do the pretentious art exhibit thing anymore.""
B: ""Yeah, I hate that pretentious stuff too, but that's where the money is. I can't work at Burger King forever. I was thinking of doing a painting of different burgers, do you think that's a good idea for an art topic?""
A: ""Like a Warhol Campbell's soup thing? I like it! I'd buy one for sure.""
B: ""Yes! I love how Andy Warhol lived by his own rules. That's really inspiring to me. He made a ton of money that way too. What inspired your paintings?""
A: ""Well I liked to create futuristic paintings because my reality was so depressing. It was a way for me to escape to another world. You could probably channel something similar with the way your family treats you. Put that angst into your work.""
B: ""Ah, ok. So the paintings were about a world you wanted to see. Angst is a good topic for art I think. Some of the best music comes from expressing anger.  It's just when you see a lot of art, it's all flowers and kittens. I think painting a burger elevates the common to something glorious. I want people to think of burgers in a new way, like you did with your futuristic paintings.""

A: ""Oh wow im so jealous. I enjoy both but for me i would say i enjoy the summer olympics more just because i understand the rules of most of the sports played, compared to the winter olympics. But i would sure love to try skiing one day.""
B: ""Skiing is fun, but I am much better at ""apres ski"" activities!""
A: ""One day i will try that too. I also so see your into sky diving you are so brave. I would love to try but that one defiantly scares me. Haha. ""

B: ""I'm sure I would enjoy it, please send it to me. Have you ever went to watch the Tour de France in person?""
A: ""No I always wanted to go. I think it would be really exciting seeing it in person. Have you?""

A: ""That sounds amazing. I have however been to some football matches, I am excited for the season. I think the Bayern Munich have a good team this year, do you like their chances? ""
B: ""They are going to win Bundesliga, I can just feel it. They are unstoppable! ""
A: ""Maybe some time I can come visit you in Germany. I'm getting close to being done with Grad School. We can go to a game together!""
B: ""I like that idea. For now, I think you should take me to an American Football game. You can teach me the rules and tell me who I should support""
A: ""I can do that for sure. It's a lot different than European Football but I'm sure you'll catch on right away.  ""
B: ""I've tried to learn but there are just so many different players. I couldn't keep it all straight in my head""
A: ""You don't have to take it too serious, just come out and we can have fun. Maybe have a beer or two and just catch up. ""
B: ""Sounds like a great idea. We can organize a time to do it later""
A: ""I just completed one of the last assignments for my graduate program!""
B: ""Awesome.  How do you think you did?  Have you made your plans for Germany yet since you are almost done with school?""
A: ""I think I did well. I am cautiously optimistic.  I only struggled with one part of the exam, but I think I did well!  Now that I am done studying, I can focus on a trip to Germany over the summer!  Have you been to any fun rollercoasters lately??""
B: ""No, been working too much.  Any attractions you'd like to see on your trip>""
A: ""I love to kayak, and love to do that when I travel.  So I'd like to check out some cook kayak spots in Germany.  ""
B: ""I am in Berlin and we have kayaking tours that I am sure you'd love.  One follows the channels on the west side of the city and goes through the woods. Very beautiful.""
A: ""Oh that sounds lovely!   I would love to check that out.  I have heard the beer is exceptional in Germany as well.  Do you have any recommendations - where to get the best beer.  Is Das Boot a thing?""
B: ""It is a real thing.  They have it during out Beerfest. But that's not until September.  You should go to BrewDog's for a wide selection.""
A: ""That's awesome!  I will plan my trip for Beerfest and check out BrewDog's!  Will you be taking any time off work this summer?""
B: ""I have some time I could take.  Maybe when you get your trip planned, I could take a few days and we could meet up.  ""
A: ""That would be awesome!  We can check out a football game and drink Das Boot!""
B: ""Yes!! Absolutely. Just let me know when you get your dates planned.  This is going to be exciting.""

B: ""I play guitar a lot in my spare time. I am teaching my kids to play at the moment. They are starting to pick it up. Do you play an instrument?""

B: ""Horses are amazing animals. Do you have other animals on your farm?""
A: ""Oh yes. Dogs, cats, chickens, and goats. I love all the animals.""
B: ""Wow so many. I wish I had a pet. Animals are amazing creatures. I think I would love a parrot and see if it would dance to my guitar playing. That would be fun""

A: ""What is the best way to learn songs? Do you teach yourself? I looked up the spanish word for guitar and it is ""la guitara""""
B: ""That is good to know! Now when I am in class and we come across that word, I will already know it. I can read sheet music, so I typically look the songs up but sometimes I can play just by listening to the song and mimicking it. Have you decided whether or not you want to take Spanish lessons?""
A: ""I think you have inspired me! I am going to look into it. It helps bring out my creative side! That is so impressive you can mimic songs just by listening. I wish I had an ability like that.

B: ""I actually haven't seen any new episodes recently, only reruns. How is working on the farm going?""
A: ""Ah yes. Good thing there are plenty of seasons of reruns to watch! The farm keeps me busy. It is hard for now, but I am sure i will miss it when I am gone, so I try to take the time to enjoy it. Do you make your kids do a lot of chores around the house?""
B: ""Absolutely, most of the time they are a big help around the house but there are times when they can be very lazy and messy! Do you have any kids?""
A: ""No kids for me, unless you count my many animals as my kids! They keep me busy enough. I guess they will help prepare me for kids one day though. How old are yours?""

B: ""I'm not sure yet. Some up and coming bands I guess. As long as the music's good for dancing, I don't care all that much.""
A: ""I totally know the feeling!! There's something so intoxicating about dancing to live music with a ton of people around! ""
B: ""Would you like to go with me to the festival? ""
A: ""I would love to!! It's been a while since I've been to a festival.  That sounds fun!  I wonder if I can being my dog.  I just recently got one!  She would love a music festival!""
B: ""Sure, I think dogs are allowed. Will you be able to get off of work for the whole weekend?""
A: ""It shouldn't be a problem! My new job has been going really well, and I should be able to easily get some time away. ""
B: ""That's good. I rarely have to work weekends at my job so it's easy to leave for the festival after work on Friday and get back Sunday night in time for the work week.""
A: ""you're lucky! I wish I didn't have to work weekends, but it's not so bad. Management is super nice, and I get along with most of my coworkers, they make the  time go by fast! ""
B: ""Great! We'll meet up there. I'll bring the beer.""
A: ""My dog got scared and broke out of our yard!  I was so scared she almost got hit by a car.""
B: ""O my gosh! Thank God she was not hit by the car. You know you are allowed to take your dog in some music festivals?""
A: ""I remember you mentioned it but I haven't looked into it any further. After her escape from my home, I am a little nervous to take her anywhere else she could easily get loose.""
B: ""Oh I see. I might feel the same way if I were in your shoes. Who's gonna look for your dog next week when you start working full time?""
A: ""My sister will stop by to check on her and let her out. Otherwise she will be in the house while I am gone, so I feel pretty good about leaving her.  How has work been going for you?""
B: ""That's great! She'll be okay, that's for sure. Work is okay. Since you mentioned it, I remember that I need to update some apps on my work computer.""
A: ""Are they easy updates? I am not great with computers so it would probably take me a while.""
B: ""Yes, it wouldn't take so much time. Anyways, when is your days off now if you have to work weekends?""
A: ""They switch every other week. This week I was off yesterday and will be off on Thursday before starting my weekend shifts. Are you excited for the music festival you are going to in a few weeks?""
B: ""Absolutely! I can't wait! I heard Dua Lipa is going to be on that music festival and that's what I'm looking forward!""
A: ""That sounds like fun! Are you going to be camping?""
B: ""Probably not on this one. You should go to that music festival too! It is not on a weekend so you probably could go. They will have rock music that's for sure""

A: ""We are still playing phone tag, although it feels promising. Great to have a lead that is interested.""
B: ""I am sure you will wow them on the phone, and they will want to meet you in person! Do you think you might have to cook as part of the interview?""
A: ""Good question, the ad didn't mention this, although they may mention that when we talk. It feels good, feeding people. ""
B: ""I have never been much of a cook, but I have lovely memories of my mom making traditional Somali dishes for me when I was younger. Do you have any recipes that bring back strong memories when you are making them?""
A: ""Mostly the simple, home cooking stuff from my family. Biscuits are a fave, and my mother has a decent roast recipe. ""
B: ""What do you think you would make if that ends up being a part of the interview process?""
A: ""Well, they are a steak house. And they have pretty good ribs. Wonder what their kitchen is built like, if they have good equipment.""
B: ""Is it a fine dining steakhouse? Or more casual? Either way, I'm sure the kitchen will be amazing.""
A: ""They are kind of, reputation wise, somewhere between Sizzlers and Black Angus, which are pretty popular steakhouse chains. They're more home grown though.  ""
B: ""I love restaurants that are a bit more homey; although, I have been known to gorge on Sizzler's salad bar! I really hope you get the job. Is cooking your dream? Or  just a ""for now"" job?""
A: ""I got a call back from the steak house asking me to join.""
B: ""That's exciting. Let me know when you start so I can go and try out the restaurant.""

B: ""I hope so too. I wonder if you will be able to use any of your family recipes. That would be cool if you could.""
A: ""I'm starting out just as a sous chef assisting the main chef so maybe I can slowly introduce my recipes.  How is your dancing going?""
B: ""Good but busy. I have been practicing a lot as we have a recital coming up soon. ""
A: ""Oh that's exciting but I'll bet its nerve wracking.  How many students will be performing?""
B: ""I have six students in the contemporary class and four in hip hop. They are great kids and I hope they can get something good out of the class. There are a few that are fairly nervous about the recital.""
A: ""Maybe after the recital you could bring them to the restaurant to celebrate!""
B: ""Hey that's a great idea. I""
A: ""I think there is a big room that you can reserve, I'll check when I go next week.""
B: ""Yes please do. It would be fun to treat them to something special as they have worked so hard and many have a hard life at home.""

B: ""Oh that is so exciting, congratulations! Are you doing anything to celebrate? ""
A: ""Unfortunately, I will be working almost every night for some time.  So, I will have to wait before I can really celebrate.  You will have to come to the steak house though!  ""
B: ""Ah that's annoying but also good you're busty. But wow thanks I would love to! You'll have to give me some recommendations so I try your best dishes. Were you a chef before you started at the steak house? ""
A: ""No.  I started as a disherwasher at my last job and worked my way up to a line cook.  This new place is much nicer.  It also gives me more opportunity to expand my skills.""
B: ""Busy*. Ahh that's so impressive, you've come so far! Do you have any favorite dishes so far at the new place? ""
A: ""Our roasted pheasant salad is great.  It is like a better version of Sizzler's salad.  You would love it.  And, speaking of busy, you will have to remind me when your dance recital is.  I want to try to get the day off work to come!""
B: ""Better than Sizzler! That's a major claim. I will  definitely have to take you up on that offer and check it out. My recital is next thursday! You should definitely come, I'm a bit nervous because my knee has been playing up but if all goes well it should be a good recital! Do you like dance?""
A: ""I love to dance.  But, I am probably more amusing to watch than anything!  I hope your knee is okay.  Do you have a knee brace?  I have had knee problems in the past and found that helped me.""
B: ""Oh I'm sure you're great. And thank you. I have been wearing a brace when I'm not dancing to try to keep it all together, it does help a lot. Knees are tricky! What sort of dance do you like? ""
A: ""I like all kinds, but my favorite is the good old fashioned waltz.  A little outdated I know.  I enjoy the flow of it.  Can you waltz?  ""
B: ""Ahhh I do love to waltz. Such a beautiful dance. I've been trying to get my students on to it but they're it's very hard to direct their attention away from tiktok routines. ""

A: ""That sounds nice.  I bet you get to see a lot of great scenery while on tour like that.  How have the crowds been?""
B: ""Not too crowded.  A few sold out, but mostly cozy.  I actually like it that way.  You should come to one if you live nearby!  I'm performing at a local festival in Colorado, so you can catch that for free if you're there.""

B: ""Hopefully you negotiated some vacation time at your new job.""
A: ""I did, just like at the last place, but things get hectic. People always expect a doctor to be there when they need them. This ends up meaning that I don't get a vacation. ""
B: ""You have to make sure that you schedule time for your self.  I suggest you go ahead and put something on the calendar.  Life is short you need to take time off, even if you stay at home and just enjoy your family.""
A: ""That sounds like a good idea. I get pretty stressed out at times without any time off. I think this new place might be better though because there are more doctors around. Taking some time off should be easier.""
B: ""That's great.  How is Jessica?""
A: ""She's doing really well. She has been doing more and more shows. She is getting better with time and more shows done. Maybe one day she'll be at your level of a performer!""
B: ""I think she already is at my level, she just needs others to recognize it.  The music industry is so hard to get into.  Does she have an agent?""
A: ""Nope, no agent yet. I think I heard her mention it once or twice. Maybe you can talk to her and give her a bit of guidance. ""
B: ""I would be happy to give her some advice, please give her my contact information!""
A: ""Oh, I m really enjoying to deal with my new coworkers!""
B: ""That's good! I enjoy working with other people. Have you talked to Jessica about getting an agent?""
A: ""I haven't. I don't think she likes or even wants to talk with me about those things""

A: ""Im sure that my robot would hate that topic, it hates pretty much everything. Do you hope that all of your children will be girls?""
B: ""I don't care about their gender, really, as long as they're healthy. It will be interesting to see their different personalities. Do you think that personality is something that comes from the environment, or is it pre-programmed in their DNA?""
A: ""That is a good perspective to have. I think that some of it comes from DNA, but most of your personality comes from your environment.""
B: ""Like your robot, for example, does it hate everything because it learned that from it's surroundings? Or was it programmed to be grumpy?""
A: ""I think robots are a little different then people when it comes to that aspect. My robot can only do what it was programed to do, so it only knows how to be grumpy.""
B: ""You are probably right, I think children come a little pre-programmed, but also change because of their environment. Do you feel that you are pre-programmed, or did you learn to like the things you like because of your experiences? ""
A: ""I believe that they can come out slight pre-programed but that their environment can change that throughout their life.""
B: ""Yes, like I think I have a natural gift for gymnastics, but my parents signed me up for classes, too. Was there something that got you into robots and computer games?""
A: ""My parent sent me to science camp in 6th grade and ever since then i have been in love with robots. How the get put together, how they are programed, it is all just so fascinating to me. When your parents signed you up for classes, did that help you become a better Olympian?""

A: ""My kids love all animals, and I love that idea. We should make plans when we are all free.""
B: ""Great. Spring is a good season on the farm. Maybe we will be lucky and have some babies for them to meet. ""
A: ""I am giving most of the kittens away.""
B: ""I will take a couple from you. We need good mousers in the barn. Are you selling the kittens?""
A: ""Well, I'd be willing to give them to you. But I want something in return... Will you watch scary movies with me?""
B: ""Ok I will for some free mouse hunting barn cats lol. I really don't like them cause I get scared easily.""
A: ""Oh, no! Okay, I'll make you a deal. I'll give you a kitten for every movie you watch with me, but only one of them has to be scary. What kind of movies do you like?""
B: ""Deal. I really like all movies except scary ones. I like the Star Wars movies. Do you watch them?""
A: ""I haven't seen any, but my kids say they're good, so they must be! We should definitely bring some snacks if we're binging movies. What should we eat?""
B: ""We make cheese from the dairy cows. I can lay out a good cheese platter if you bring the crackers. Maybe something sweet too?""
A: ""Oh, that sounds perfect. I actually love baking, so I can get my kids to help make us some cookies.""
B: ""Perfect, sounds like a great plan. We just need to pick a good weekend and you bring the kids and the kittens and we will have a old fashioned movie marathon complete with snacks.""
A: ""I can't wait! Does next weekend work for you? We'd all love to see the cows while we're there too.""
B: ""That works great. I will give you and the kids a full tour of the farm and all the animals. The kids can play with the baby calfs.""

B: ""I love bunnies but I'm busy moving into a new apartment with my boyfriend""
A: ""I'd have loved to live with my girlfriend before I went into the navy""
B: ""The navy sounds tough. I teach elementary school.""
A: ""I only joined because I love the color. I much prefer working with the bunny rescue, now.""
B: ""I would like to take pictures of the bunnies. Do you help alot of rabbits?""
A: ""Yes, by volunteering and donating to them each month. What do take pictures of?""
B: ""I just enjoy photography and the colors red and silver.""
A: ""I've a silver eared bunny you would love, with a red, white, and navy blue bow.""
B: ""Your bunny sounds adorable. Bunnies are very gentle and quiet animals""
A: ""Definitely welcomed after my years in war zones. Is this your first apartment with your boyfriend?""
B: ""Yes I am excited about the move. Thank you for your service""
A: ""My service? You teach elementary school. You are the hero, here!!""
B: ""It is a challenge. I teach english spanish and french""
A: ""Oh! I just had an idea. Could you take photos of our rescue bunnies?""
B: ""I'd love too. I hope I could help the wonderful creatures""
A: ""I'm thinking of doing a fundraiser for the bunny rescue.""
B: ""That's really cool!  What kind of fundraiser are you thinking of?  I mean, will it be selling something, a walkathon, a raffle?""
A: ""Yeah it is! I am so excited. I have not decided yet. I am thinking of doing like a ""walk for the bunnies"" type thing only where people bunny hop instead of walk haha.""
B: ""Oh that would be a great idea!  I'll defnitely sign up when you do!  Speaking of bunnies, how is yours doing?""
A: ""He is doing really great. I am thinking about getting him a friend though. He seems lonely sometimes. Do bunnies get lonely?""
B: ""i think they do.  I've seen wild ones playing together out in the yard at my parent's house.  They chase each other around and look so happy!""
A: ""WILD BUNNIES!?!?! Oh Em Gee that is adorable. Maybe you could tape them and send me a video. OHHHH I could do a bunny video contest with a cash prize with entry fees as a fund raiser""
B: ""Hey! Now there's a neat idea!  People love to make videos of all kinds of things!""
A: ""I could do like  a grand prize of 20% of the entry fees and a second place prize of 5% of the fees. Third place can get like a starbucks gift card or a chocolate easter bunny lol.""
B: ""Sounds like a plan!  So, now you just have to decide on a start date.""
A: ""You are a teacher, don't you know how to make good flyers?""
B: ""I do!  Do you want me to make the flyers for your fundraiser?  Are you okay with the primary colors being red and silver?""
A: ""I have decided I definitely want to do the bunny hop fundraiser!""
B: ""That's amazing! What is your role going to be in the fundraiser?""
A: ""Organizer mainly, but I am sure I will do a little of everything. Would you like to come? Maybe you could adopt a bunny?""
B: ""Ha ha maybe, although I'd have to check with my boyfriend first! I would love to come and see the bunnies, though. Maybe I could be your photographer for the event?""
A: ""That would be amazing! Ask him and let me know. I would love you to take photos for the event. It would help get the word out afterwards as well! ""
B: ""Yes, count me in for photography duties. Do you think you're going to get another bunny soon?""
A: ""I can't say for sure. But I would assume I will come across one in need and adopt it. I can't say no. I am sure your students would love to meet some bunnies. I can bring some to your class if you would like. ""
B: ""My students love animals.  They would go nuts over a bunny in the classroom.  I will have to ask my principal about it first.  Have you taken your bunny to a lot of places?""
A: ""Just let me know and I will bring them in. I try to take my bunnies anywhere they are allowed. They love people and it helps people appreciate them. ""
B: ""What's not to love about a bunny? They are so cuddly and adorable!  Is it hard to housetrain one?""
A: ""They are very easy to house train actually. And great house or apartment pets. I like to bring awareness to their size when full grown and handling needs. ""
B: ""Yes, I've heard that they can be hard to handle if they aren't socialized properly.  My cousin had one when we were kids, and he carried that bunny with him everywhere.  He even put it in his bike basket and rode it around town. ""
A: ""Have you spoken to your boyfriend about adopting a bunny?""
B: ""He said yes! It is a 2 bedroom apartment so we are going to make one entire room a bunny room!""
A: ""That's great! When will you be moving in, and when will you be getting a bunny?""
B: ""We are moving this weekend. So we'll probably get the bunny next weekend. What do you think we should put in the bunny room?""
A: ""A litter box, food and water bowls, a hay box and a cardboard castle - and that's just for starters! What kind of bunny are you thinking of getting?""
B: ""A think a mini rex. They are supposed to be pretty calm. What kind of bunny do you have?""
A: ""I have a silver Martin rabbit. It has a very sweet disposition. Do you know where you want to get your rabbit from?""
B: ""I am hoping to get a rescue! I don't want to go to a pet store. Do you have any recommendations?""
A: ""Well, I don't want to sound biased, but I think the one I volunteer for is pretty great. Would you be okay with it if I gave you their name and contact information? That way you can look them up and see if they're right for you.""
B: ""Yes! That would be great! I am really not picky about the breed if I can give a needy rabbit a loving home!""
A: ""OK. It's called the Bunny Bunch, in Orange County. The address is 10534 Bechler River Avenue, Fountain Valley, California 92708. Their phone number is 1-833-3RABBIT.""

A: ""I just learned to cook fish!""
B: ""I thought you already knew! What kind of fish did you cook? And how? ""

B: ""That sounds better than a restaurant. We should catch some fish on my boat and then you can teach me that recipe! I have caught more fish but keep throwing them back. ""
A: ""I'd love that! As long as I can bring my dog, I can find a pet sitter for the cat- but would be great to spend the day out on the water.  I'm sure theres some Mexican fish recipes we can try too!  Fishing is one of the things I love about Florida- fresh fish all the time, and if you catch too much, just throw em back in!""
B: ""You can definitely bring your dog! I would love that! What is its name?""
A: ""His name is Petey- he's a great fishing partner.  Have you ever been to New Zealand? I've heard the trout fishing down that in Lake Taupo is some of the best in the world.  Its on my bucket list!""
B: ""I have been, but I never spent much time there. We can literally take the yacht wherever you like as long as it is not already rented out during that time.""
A: ""that would be so awesome!  How often is it rented out?  Is it a year round thing or more seasonal?""
B: ""Started as seasonal, but is basically year round now. I use it whenever it is free though! I have only had a handful of bad renters.""
A: ""Do you send a crew out with the yacht when you rent it? Or do the renters need to know how to sail?""
B: ""The renters have to know or hire their own crew, which a lot of them do. But some people don't even sail! They just want to hang out on it!""

A: ""Well we decided to have it in Australia because most of our friends and families are here. Do you think we should have the wedding ceremony in the open air like next to a beach or like a grassland or something of that sort?""
B: ""Having it in the open like that creates a more relaxing atmosphere and can create great photo ops. It creates a romantic flair and there is just something magical about exchanging vows near or on the beach. ""
A: ""Yessss!!! Sooo true and who doesn't want an awesome flair and magic in their special wedding. But OMG I am so rude that I never asked you about your wedding plans. So when are you getting married and any plans yet?""

A: ""Wow that's an awesome plan for a wedding. But definitely the expenses do play. I am sure there should plenty of beautiful beaches in West Virginia or else if you are planning on a destination wedding you could come down to Australia, right!!""
B: ""I never been to Australia but you guys have some of the most famous beaches and coastline in the world.""
A: ""True there are really beautiful beaches and shores all over Australia's coastline, which is why it is hard for us to decide which one to have our wedding at if we go in that route.

B: ""You will have to tell me how it is different! Are you nervous for the procedure? Do they have to put you to sleep or anything?""
A: ""Yeah, they are going to put me under. I think that part is what I am most nervous about. It is so weird that you can just inhale something and pass out in a few seconds""
B: ""Yeah I think they actually inject you with something too. I've been under anesthesia a couple times. It's weird because it feels like no time has passed at all even if it's  been hours. How long is the procedure?""
A: ""A couple hours I believe. I know the benefits are going to be great, I just watch a lot of movies and sometimes small things can cause big problems!""
B: ""Yeah, but remember movies aren't reality! What movies do you like the most?""
A: ""I am big into the Marvel movies, I am very excited to see how they implement the X-Men into the marvel universe ""
B: ""I'm into Marvel movies too! Civil War is my favorite movie. I'm not that into X-Men but I guess I will be!""

A: ""Long johns.  I love the kind filled with bavarian cream!  You ever been to Daylight Donuts?  They make some great ones!""
B: ""No ive never tried daylight doughnuts. Are there any locations other than in oklahoma ? Have you ever tried krispy kreme?""
A: ""There's some here in Alabama.  I have tried Krispy Kreme!  They make amazing glazed donuts and have great deals sometimes in their app.  But I admit I prefer Daylight Donuts' long johns.""

A: ""I don't have a favorite.  I admit I gravitated towards them because of the name ;-) ""

B: ""Really? I gotta try that place soon. I wanna try the doughnut holes!""
A: ""Yea, it was a place called Voodoo donuts. Have you heard of it? ""
B: ""I haven't heard of that one. Is it better than Daylight?""
A: ""I will always love Daylight but they were pretty great. They had some interesting options as well that were pretty funny. I heard at the end of the night they sell 5 gallon buckets of donuts for $10. ""
B: ""No way!! That's a lot. I know a lot of places that will sell them really cheap at night because they were made in the morning but 10$ is a steal.""

A: ""My car broke down and I need your help!""
B: ""Oh! Sorry about that. Is it an old car or a new car?""
A: ""Its a 2012 Honda Civic, so pretty new compared to your vintage mustangs. Do you think you could help?""
B: ""Oh probably not. The cars I work on are really old and American. I wouldn't know what to do with a Japanese car! Have you tried looking online for a video that explaining how to fix it?""
A: ""Yeah but I'm not very handy and don't have many tools. But I guess I can take this as a learning experience and try to be more frugal! And I can take the money I saved to buy the new Call of Duty.""
B: ""Yes, I hear those games can be expensive. But learning to be handy can definitely help you save money to buy things you really enjoy. Like concerts, for example, have you seen any of your favorite bands live?""
A: ""I've seen Limp Bizkit, but I really want to see Insane Clown Posse sometime soon! Are there any other bands you recommend for me to try and see live?""
B: ""Well, I don't know much about Limp Bizkit or Insane Clown Posse, and the bands I like you probably wouldn't. Although it's always good to try new things. Speaking of trying new things, how was Voodoo Donuts?""
A: ""I can't stop going! All of their donuts are so good! I should go at the end of the day to see if they really do sell 5 gallon buckets for $10.""

A: ""I think so! Although maybe not in the end-of-day buckets!""

A: ""well yes you are definitely right about that. however I know that young boys probably find things like that exciting lol. it would be like an adventure!""
B: ""Yeah he is more into outdoor adventure like riding the trails on his mountain bike. Which is fine by me because its easier to sniff around the ladies sans crotch fruit if you know what I mean.""

A: ""What do you do andie? Do you work?""
B: ""Yes I work. I am in the construction business, I mainly build houses. What about you?""
A: ""I'm a teacher, I teach high school english.""
B: ""That is wonderful. Do you have any pets?""
A: ""Yes, a dog. He is smart. Do you have pets?""
B: ""I have five cats. I am a cat person, they're so special to me!""
A: ""Wow, five! They probably keep you busy.""
B: ""Oh yes. I always knew I would be a crazy old cat lady.""
A: ""Are you married? What does your family think of the cats?""
B: ""No, I've never found love. Men always want me to choose between them or the cats.""
A: ""Men! I often wish they were a bit more understanding...""
B: ""I could not agree more! I miss my dad, the best man I know.""
A: ""Has he passed away? How long ago?""
B: ""When I was 16. Luckily, he taught me everything I know about construction.""
A: ""How is your business doing? How are your cats doing?""
B: ""Oh, I don't own the business ha! I do some side jobs on my own. My company is doing alright I guess. We have 3 houses my crew is working on. My cats are on my nerves today. What about your puppy?""
A: ""Oh, alright. What kind of side jobs do you do? My students are getting on my nerves and I've been considering a career switch LOL. My dog is just his usual self, lazing around. I think I'll take him to his favorite park later today.""
B: ""Well, I do some roofing and laying carpets or installing cabinets in the evening mostly. I work for those that cant afford to go through a real company and charge them what they can afford after buying materials. ""
A: ""Oh, wow that sounds really cool! Very noble of you, sir. Do you think you'll ever start your own business? If you ever do, I could do all your advertising through social media! ""
B: ""Probably not ha. I have a soft heart and would never make much money. But thanks. If you ever need work done, let me know. What did the kids at the school do to irritate you?""
A: ""The kids are great and I learn a lot from them even though I'm the teacher, but they've been getting too excited for summer and have been a bit out of control. I don't blame them, though. I remember when I was their age lol. How about all those cats of yours?""
B: ""Well, Oliver made Sandy mad, and now she keeps knocking all my plants over. And the youngest one just finally got old enough to get fixed, and she got out of the house. She didn't come back for 3 days, and I thought she might be dead. But she didn't get hurt, so now she is going straight to the vet in the morning. ""
A: ""Lol cats really have their own unique personalities. What did you name the youngest kitty? I'm so glad she's safe! You must have been worried sick.""
B: ""Well, I was calling her Gloria, but now she is Hudini even though she is female because I have no idea how she got outside. I just noticed her at the mailbox, and then she was on my bed this morning. ""
A: ""She can be Houdini's little sister. No clue if he even had one, but he does now lol. Kittens are sneaky little creatures. And you know what they say about curiosity and cats... but I'm so glad she's safe. And has a great new name!""
B: ""I am glad too. I got attached to her the second I saw her. I usually don't like calicos, but her markings are so amazing! Does your dog have a story behind his name?""
A: ""How are your cats? Has Hudini gotten out again>""
B: ""Yup! He truly lives up to his name- he is a master at slipping out of the house unnoticed. Does your puppy ever get into places he's not supposed to be in?""
A: ""I'm going surfing this weekend.""
B: ""Oh cool! Where are you going surfing? Do you surf a lot?""
A: ""I understand about your cat. My mother had a cat that escaped all the time.""
B: ""What did your mom do to keep the cat from escaping? I feel like I've tried just about everything!""
A: ""She took out the doggy door. Ha Ha. She kept asking how the cat could get out and I pointed to the doggy door.""
B: ""LOL. I don't have a doggy door but that makes sense as to how her cat kept escaping. I think I need to fix the locks on my doors. They don't quite close fully and I think Hudini might be able to squeeze through the crack.""
A: ""Sounds like a plan. My puppy is doing fine. He stays where I put him right now.""
B: ""Aw! Sounds like a good boy. What's his name?""
A: ""You should go to the hardware store and buy the stuff to fix your doors on your own. It'll save you a lot of money compared to having a professional come and do it. ""
B: ""I totally agree with you, but I'm not sure if I'm losing more money than I save by fixing that instead of going to work for a day""
A: ""I can understand that but sometimes you have to make sacrifices. ""
B: ""Yeah you're right, having doors that don't lock is incredibly unsafe. I'm going to ask for the day off tomorrow. Maybe some of the other workers can help me when they get off of their shift""
A: ""Right and they might help you if you pay. Nothing in life is free! Haha.""
B: ""Hey! They are my co workers...I can hope they'd help me out a little bit! By the time they are off I'm hoping to have most of it done. I'll treat them to some beers!""
A: ""Haha right right! Didn't they make a movie out of one of Stephen King's books?""
B: ""Which book are you talking about? All I know about Stephen King is IT the clown movie haha""
A: ""Right! With the clown i believe. Isn't Jeepers Creepers his to?""
B: ""I have never seen that, so I do not know! Is that a good movie?""
A: ""Ok, and it is pretty scary. Well at the time I watched. What kind of Corvette you have?""
B: ""I wish I had a Corvette! I can't even afford to leave work to fix the locks on my doors!""

A: ""Lol. Who doesn't enjoy food? What do you do for a living""
B: ""Even though I like to cook I am not great at it.""
A: ""I learned how to cook when I was laid off and stayed home with my son""
B: ""I own a yacht but also rent it out""
A: ""That sounds fun, I'll have to talk about a boat with my wife, she loves water.""
B: ""That's awesome! I also grave and have done it for years""

A: ""My wife does not nag.""
B: ""My mom does, it can be so annoying""
A: ""I just cook something delicious for lunch. Do you want to see the recipe?""
B: ""Certainly. What did you make? I love cooking, or trying to.""
A: ""I made a really easy spaghetti dish that is perfect for a warm spring or summer day!  First you take a couple cans of stewed tomatoes with onion and garlic, or you can use fresh tomatoes, onion and garlic.  Place them in a skillet with some more diced white onion and garlic and heat it up. While that's heating cook as much pasta of whatever type you want. Then after draining the pasta mix it with your tomato sauce and your done!""
B: ""You don't put meat in yours?""
A: ""No but you can if you want. This is a really light spaghetti. The sauce is even light but packed with flavor. It's not heavy like a traditional spaghetti and meatball dish.""
B: ""Sounds delicious, but I would add ground beef or venison.""
A: ""That sounds good!  Have you made anything new lately?""
B: ""Not lately. My mom gets annoyed when I cook because I make a mess. She's always annoyed.""
A: ""Hahaha!  Oh well, she'll get over it.  How's your yacht rental business going?""
B: ""It's pretty successful now that it's getting warmer! It's a lot of fun.""
A: ""Have you had any interesting people rent it out?  I'm wondering if you have seen anything odd or something.""
B: ""Nothing odd. Just people wanting to have fun. It was very nice talking to you!""
A: ""I had a conversation with a friend who said they were interested in renting a yacht.""
B: ""I totally would recommend it. Renting a yacht has eased up some of the annoyances in my life. Have you cooked anything recently?""
A: ""I have been cooking a lot lately, with all the free time.   Last night we made Chicago deep dish pizza, it was very good if I may say so myself.   I will relay the yachting info to my friend. ""
B: ""That deep dish pizza sounds so good. You'll have to email me the recipe so I can try making it. I'm sure my mom would like to try it too.""
A: ""Of course, it's pretty easy to make I'm sure you and your mother would enjoy it also.   How is she? relaxed I hope.  ""
B: ""She's been good for the most part but sometimes the little things still bother her. Thanks for asking. How's your wife?""
A: ""She's chill as always, she's taking our son to the gym today then I think she's going swimming.  I'll tell her you ask about her.   With them out of the house it gives me a chance to look for a job.  ""
B: ""Your household always sounds so active with between your son's sports and wife's water adventures. How is the job search coming along?""
A: ""It's going ok, yes it's always crazy her.   We'll all have to get together soon and dine out.  Try something new.""
B: ""Dining out sounds amazing. I love trying new food. If we want to stay in maybe you could teach me how to make one of your recipes. ""
A: ""That could be fun too, I'm always up for teaching and show off my culinary skills.   Just let me know what you and your mother would like and we could set it up soon.  ""
B: ""Sounds great I will make sure to let you know.""

B: ""I hope you get it. Do you think you'll get free burgers and milkshakes? I'll come visit you if you do, just to get away from my mother.""
A: ""Hopefully! Haha. You can escape to the diner whenever you want. Have you thought about getting a job?""
B: ""I make a bit of money renting out my yacht but I need to get a real job. I applied to work at a sports shop but haven't heard back yet.""
A: ""That sounds like a dream job for you! Does the store specialize in soccer?""
B: ""Yeah they sell some soccer stuff and golf too so my Dad would love it. Have you been doing any sport with your son lately?""
A: ""Awesome! We have been going to the gym together a lot lately. I feel a lot more healthy and it is a great bonding experience for us. It is hard to find ways to spend time with him as he gets older!""

A: ""Hi. I'm studying to keep my straight as up. What about you?""
B: ""Well I worked with human services for 10 years, now I'm a father who stays home.""
A: ""Cool. Have you ever won a homecoming? This year I won queen!""
B: ""My wife, my queen died. She was murdered. Now my favorite moves are horror.""
A: ""Sorry to hear! Do you have a current goal? Running a k is my goal.""
B: ""My goal is raising my son, he's in junior high. He has been traumatized""
A: ""That's sad. Does he know what he wants to be when he grows up?""
B: ""I hope he is like his mother, I make him watch the horror movies with me.""
A: ""That's cool! I love horror movies as well!""
B: ""My son, sometimes he reminds me of my dead wife and I wish he would go away""
A: ""Well that's sad. It isn't his fault. I hope that changes.""

A: ""I'd but I do not think my parents would like that.""

B: ""Oh great! What's the name of it? I might go see it with my son. ""
A: ""It is called ""One Night In The Cave"", I am super excited about it. You and him should go! It warms my heart that you two are having a good relationship.""
B: ""It's getting better. Sometimes I feel guilty that I'm so excited for him to go to college, but trying to enjoy the time we have left.""
A: ""No matter what, just cherish all the moments you get with him, life sure is a fleeting thing. He is a smart and great kid. It is so cool that he enjoy the horror movies with you, my kids think my obsession with horror films is odd.""
B: ""Haha! I bet they are proud of your other hobbies, though. How have you been doing with the running?""
A: ""I have been getting better and better. I have been setting goals for myself. I decided I need to not still be hung up on things that happened in high school and be more committed to the future so that is why I have become such a health and fitness nut. Have you ever considered going to the gym to get your mind off of things?""
B: ""That's awesome! Yes, I can totally see your dedication. Taking up studying, winning the Homecoming title, all really great to hear. My wife and I used to go to the gym every day. It's been hard to go back since the accident.""
A: ""I totally understand. Have you thought about maybe going back to college? All my studying is a good mental exercise and puts me in a good headspace.""
B: ""Maybe. I think I'm too old for that now, plus I've got a pretty decent position. I think when my son goes to college I might take a sabbatical and travel for a month or two.""
A: ""That is another excellent way to get a feeling of a fresh start. Where might you travel to?""
B: ""I was thinking about going to Europe and ending in Paris. My wife, Lisa always wanted to go there with me. We never got a chance.""
A: ""I hope you and your son are doing well. Is he starting to get excited about heading off to college? ""
B: ""We are doing ok. Thank you for asking. He is nervous. I am more excited than he is. How are your children doing?""
A: ""My sons are doing great. Thanks for asking. We have been going for walks as a family lately.""
B: ""Are they runners like yourself? My son and I are slowly getting into fitness. We are also trying to take walks everyday. The fresh air helps our moods everyday.""
A: ""They don't enjoy running as much as I do that's why we've been sticking to walks, but at least I can get them outside and active. I agree the outdoors helps me destress from my school studies.""
B: ""Fresh air just has so many health advantages. How are your studies going?""
A: ""My studies are going well, but sometimes I just want to get away. Have you been considering leaving to travel still?""
B: ""Yes, I am saving for a big Europe trip. I think my son would love it. Do you have plans to travel or just hopes to?""
A: ""That sounds so exciting for both of you. I hope some day to maybe after I complete college. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in Europe.""
B: ""It'll be a dream come true to actually make it after talking about it for so long. You'll get to travel soon too I hope. Studies first then comes all the traveling.""
A: ""You and your son have been through so much I""
B: ""Thank you. It helps to have each other when going through a trauma like we have. You are very kind.""
A: ""My sons said they would like to meet your son. Maybe we could get our sons together for a walk sometime?""
B: ""I think that would be great.  He is new an could use some friends and a different perspective since it has been difficult at home.""
A: ""I would love to be able to help that. Yourself and him have been through so much that I am sure it would relieve some pressure. Maybe we could watch a movie whilst they spend some time together?""
B: ""I would really appreciate that.  I admire that you are also into fitness and have goals.  That is what he could use right about now.  ""
A: ""I have some running plans that I could give him to take to college with him to give him something other than work to focus on, if that would useful?""

B: ""I remember that one.  I think it was with Russell Crowe?  I prefer action and comedies myself.  But a good deep movie is just as good.  Good Will Hunting is an all time fave of mine and my son.""
A: ""Yes, I love Good Will Hunting, also. It portrays such a good message that I am sure your son can take a lot from.""
B: ""For sure.  It shows everyone struggles at some point even if you are :wicked smaht""...  I am going to set a goal for myself to run an 8 minute mile thanks for opening my eyes.""
A: ""No problem at all. It is a great goal to set and you will feel so accomplished when you achieve it. After that, you can set a quicker goal, then a quicker one etc""
B: ""I think that sounds like a great plan.  I am getting better at living in the present and not in the past.  But it is hard.  Meditation is helping a lot along with being active each day.  I need to find a group or someone to keep me motivated though.""

A: ""Isn't Etsy great for fun, creative, kitschy stuff? My cat's name is Fluffy. I know, it's not that original, but it's quite fitting, as she's fuzzy, cuddly, and cute as can be! Have you picked out a name for the baby yet?""
B: ""My cats are Tag and Henry. Tag is a maine coone mix so he is fluffy too! I think the baby's name will be Rachel for a girl or Gregory for a boy.""

A: ""She does love pizza. Sometimes I order it from the local pizzeria, and other times I bring home a frozen pizza from the supermarket where I work. Do your cats enjoy human food, too?""
B: ""they do, they do! Tag LOVES avocados / guacamole. Henry loves meatballs. They're so funny! I love how they chew their food. Is fluffy cute when she eats?""
A: ""Work has been good, I brought home a new frozen pizza with olives to try. I am also thinking of purchasing a cat toy from Etsy.  Have you purchased any cat toys off Etsy?""
B: ""I haven't purchased any cat toys off Etsy. I usually get them from the pet store, as I like to see and feel them before I buy them. How was the pizza?""
A: ""It was good as expected. Pretty much any pizza with olives on it is good. I don't think I've had a bad one in my life. I was thinking about getting a cat nip toy off of Etsy. I love watching cats go nuts on cat nip.""
B: ""I think olives are an acquired taste. Luckily, I've acquired it! I like olives on my pizza, too. My cats don't really like catnip. They get a little hyper for a short period of time, then they get bored and leave it. I've tried a couple of times, but with the same result. Now ping pong balls drive them crazy!""
A: ""Hmm, I've never tried to ping pong balls thing. I'm going to have to get some and see what my cat does. Any other toys your cats like?""
B: ""The ping pong balls are great. And they're cheap, so I don't mind when I step on them and break them! Tag and Henry bat them all over the house. They bounce off the furniture and base boards and really move on the hardwood floors of our house. They do get stuck under furniture, but I just use a broom to scoop them out. It is getting harder to bend down with my belly getting bigger. Laser pointers are another good toy for cats, and easy on my back!""
A: ""That sounds like a lot of fun for the cats. I wonder if they are playing a game against each other that only they know about. The laser pointer sounds like fun as well.""
B: ""Yeah, it seems like it sometimes. When one gets going, the other joins in. It's like they're talking to each other, ""Hey, come on. Let's play!"" The one drawback with the laser pointer is that there is only one, so they compete a little bit with each other. The looks they give each other are priceless!""
A: ""Haha, that sounds like so much fun. I am going to be doing some searching on Etsy now to find these things. Do your cats ever try to eat your birds?""
B: ""No, they pretty much ignore them. I think they know they're not food. But the birds get nervous around the cats, for sure. They quickly become silent when the cats are around. I keep the birds in a separate room, so as to not stress them out. The birds outside are fair game though. I often get little presents on the porch after the cats go out.""
A: ""I've had my cat do that as well. They've also brought back some little rodents, like chipmunks. ""
B: ""My yard is mostly gopher-free because of Tag and Henry. It's a little bit gross, but I guess it's their nature to hunt, even if it's not for food.""
A: ""My cat enjoyed the toy I bought for her from Etsy.""
B: ""That's fun. What kind of toy did you get her?""
A: ""I bought her a pizza shaped toy that i can pull of a string.""
B: ""I might have to look for one of those. I love playing with my cats, they are so funny. What is the toy made of?""
A: ""The pizza is made of a soft fuzzy material and the string is a jute string. Are you excited to have December 16th getting closer?""
B: ""I am but it still feels like an awfully long way away. So I'm just trying to stay busy, maybe I'll get a bunch of cat toys to keep me and the cats distracted!""
A: ""That is always a wonderful way to keep yourself busy. How many hours a day do you work at the restaurant? I am sure it has to be pretty tiring being on your feet all day.""
B: ""It really is. Right now I'm working 8 hours or more a day, but soon I'll cut back some. I'm planning to take off for a while after  the baby comes. You must know how it is, working in a supermarket I bet you're on your feet a lot too.""
A: ""Yes, it is a lot of going back and forth through out the store. I just keep telling myself it is worth it to keep saving money to travel again. I want to be able to have extra money soon to be able to start a trip. ""
B: ""That's exciting! Where all do you want to go? ""

B: ""That is awesome! You should be so proud of yourself for juggling school and being a mother. The last time I was in school was college, and I cannot imagine caring for a baby while taking classes. Good on you! ""
A: ""I find the a lot of people judge me for having a child so young it's been really hard on me actually. thanks for your support it means a lot. not many people realise just how hard it is!""
B: ""That's sad, because I bet they don't realize how much extra work it takes. Does your husband help, too, or is he not able to because of his disability?""
A: ""He does what he can and he helps out massively but it's not the same as having a fully able-bodied husband. I do feel like I have more challenges than the average person my age lol""
B: ""You most definitely do, but God gives his biggest challenges to His strongest soldiers. ""
A: ""I do sometimes find quite a lot of comfort in prayer. do you go to church on Sundays?""
B: ""I do go to church, do you?""
A: ""I do believe but I don't go to church myself. I have been thinking about starting. I think it would be good to meet like minded people.""
B: ""It can definitely be helpful to meet like minded people. Churches often sometimes have daycares, too, so that could help!""
A: ""I signed up for a fitness class so that i can complete my goal of running a 5k. how cool is that?""
B: ""That sounds great! I wish you all luck to complete your goal.""
A: ""Thank you so much. I am very excited about it, but definitely nervous. Praying that I will have time to do it all and still be a good mom.""
B: ""Don't worry you will definitely be a super mom after all that you have gone through for these many years. Why don't you go to church this week?""
A: ""That is a lot to add to my plate at once, but might be worth it. I do need His guidance now more than ever. ""
B: ""Yes it will surely be a relief going to church. How is your baby?""
A: ""He is wonderful. My parents have been so helpful. I really cannot thank them enough. What about you? How are you feeling now? I cannot even imagine having twins!!!!!!""
B: ""I have started to feel my contractions. Most of the time I am really tired carrying twins. Your lucky to have such helpful parents.""
A: ""I bet. It sounds exhausting! How far along are you?""
B: ""my due date is within 2 months. I wish to be normal and calm during this time period.""
A: ""Is church helping you with that?""
B: ""Yes. I never miss my church day. It feels relaxing to go pray.""

A: ""I'm not sure. I've only been working this job for a month or so, so I don't know how often he frequents the place.""
B: ""What made him so awesome?""
A: ""He had a great personality, was very courteous, and was humorous. Maybe I should reach out to him to see if he's interested in meeting outside of work.""
B: ""Yes, next time he comes in to your work i think you guys should exchange phone numbers. This will make your dad happy.""
A: ""I think so, too. You know, you've been married for quite a while. In your opinion, what are things that make a relationship work?""
B: ""There has to be communication and honesty, Without those 2 things a relationship can break down very fast.""
A: ""That's good advice. Are there any thing you two do (either together, or along with your kids) that helps you two maintain an open and honest line of communication with each other, even during disagreements and/or stressful times?""
B: ""Always try to have a date night without kids a couple times a month. Sometimes as a parent you forget about your adult relationships because you are so busy with kids. Also going hiking outdoors as a family gives a good opportunity to have discussions.""
A: ""That's some great advice. How about communicating with your kids? How do you make sure they feel heard and understood? I don't think I'm ready for kids yet, but I'm collecting advice just for future reference, and I'd love your opinion.""
B: ""Whenever the kids talk i always try to pay close attention to everything they are saying. I try to not blow off their concerns or issues even if they do not seem like a big deal to myself.""
A: ""I saw the guy again today and heard your voice telling me to talk to him. I was just too nervous to say anything!""
B: ""I get it, I remember being very nervous when I met my husband! You could just strike up a conversation with him and if you feel comfortable by the end of it, ask him out.""
A: ""Good advice. My parents put so much pressure on me to have kids that it's always in the back of my mind. Do you ever regret having kids so young?""
B: ""No. Don't get me wrong, it gets stressful at times but they will be out of the house when we are fairly young so my husband and I will have a lot of time to do the things we want.""
A: ""Your kids are the best too, they're so well behaved and happy. You're such a good mom!""

B: ""Great idea! Where would you like to go? You choose! ""
A: ""Somewhere that has good steaks. I'm craving a really big ribeye... no change there then, ha,""
B: ""Haha! I was going to suggest the same thing. How about that new steakhouse downtown? I heard it's really good there, although it's pricey. ""

B: ""Jimmie Johnson, that guy was a beast, he would always win!""
A: ""Have you thought of all the components to your NASCAR inspired dish yet?""
B: ""Not all of them, but it has to be something meat related, and I'm thinking of having some sort of beer discount during the races. You have any ideas on something I could add to the ribeye?""
A: ""I think a spicy run on the ribeye would be good, and the spiciness of it will have people buying more beers.  win/win situation!""
B: ""That's a brilliant idea, I need to get in the kitchen and test some things out. It would be great if I could make my own special rub. You think any drivers would come and try it? It could really increase some business ""

B: ""Not the first, but it has been the coolest so far. I got some yellow ribbon and a yellow plate at the thrift store, too. That will be great when you can finally move out and we can chill at the new apartment. I feel like whenever I come over your parents are judging me.""
A: ""Yeah, they're like that. For no apparent reason too most of the time. Too many years of being segregated by the confines of the church for them, I think. Don't get me wrong, church is good. It promotes healthy family values when approached with an open-mind. Being a fear-mongering bible-thumper is where it becomes a detriment, which unfortunately is the subsect of Catholicism they've fallen into. It'll never change.  ""
B: ""Yeah I totally get it. Ever since we snuck out that one time to go to Kyle's party they've been seriously crazy! We are basically adults. It's not like you'll be their Christian good girl all of a sudden when you leave the house. ""
A: ""Right? I heard 3 hours of bible verses over that the next day related to ""WHAT WOULD JESUS THINK"". Well evidently not a single thing as worms have been living inside his skull for the past 2000 years. They really lost it when I said that. Surprised they didn't start trying to sprinkle holy water on me while screaming for the devil to get out. Is what it is. Shouldn't be a problem for too much longer anyway. ""
B: ""Hahaha man I wonder what they'd say if they saw your Tik Tok dance of you getting down to WAP. I'm a gymnast and even I can't stretch like that. ""
A: ""Their heads would start doing 360s and then it'd be me pulling out the bible if I saw that lmao. Anyway, enough about them. Feels like beating a dead horse every time we talk about my parents. Any new ideas on what your next collection items will be?""
B: ""There's a yellow quilt that I saw online that I really want. It's like $300 though. So I'll have to save up. My whole bedroom is going to be all yellow soon enough.""
A: ""Nice! That is a lot of money for a quilt, but it's probably really good material and worth it. Have you painted the walls yellow yet? Who knew winning gold would go this far, Chels, haha. ""
B: ""One wall is yellow wallpaper with a floral design on it and the other wall is yellow wallpaper with stripes. Maybe I'll do some sort of yellow paint on the other walls. And a yellow chandelier! I feel like it has become a little over the top but it's just so cheery. I love it. ""
A: ""My parents saw me looking at apartments for rent and they gave me yet another lecture on ""What Would Jesus Do"". So annoying. ""
B: ""Have you told them how you feel? maybe if you talked to them they would understand?""
A: ""I've tried talking to them a bit. My dad listens but not my mom.    Have you started your collection yet? I saw a mini yellow school bus that would be a perfect start lol""
B: ""Well maybe work on your dad. I think over time he can work on your mom. Well, the thing about collecting yellow things is where do you start. I think a yellow school bus would be great and I can add create a yellow area to store my items!""
A: ""I'm a fan of yard sales too. It's one of the few things I enjoy doing with my mom.    Did you get to travel a lot for gymnastics?. i'm still really impressed you have a gold medal.""
B: ""I know. Lots of hard work but it is a great talking point with people, I think I need to move on to something new though because yes, like any competition there is lots of travel and lots of championships to compete in which gets draining over time.""
A: ""Something more laid back does sound nice. Having a choice sounds nice honestly. The women in my church have to be chicken farmers and my parents and the church are really pushing me into that.  it's why i need my own place, off the farm. The chickens hate me.""

B: ""I'm not sure the devil has an iPhone but if he did I'm sure he would watch TikTok :-) ""
A: ""LOl.  I'll have to disagree, I know for a fact my mom DOES have an iPhone lol.  Have you found any good items at the thrift stores recently? My town is too small to have one but they sound cool.""

A: ""My youngest is 10 and she managed to hike the trail well. It is a little under 3 miles and the terrain is fairly flat and the trails are well groomed. Does that seem a good level for your mom? The park has one that is just a bit harder and longer.""
B: ""Oh that should be fine then. She isn't as confident as she used to be but if a 10 year old can do it then I'm sure she can too. It's good that you go out with your family and get some exercise. That's so important for young ones these days I think. ""
A: ""Does your mom just hike with you, or does she mountain bike as well? I love hiking because it is such good exercise and quality family time as well.""

B: ""I don't actually. I mean I do take some pictures on my phone sometimes but not like real photography. How about you?""
A: ""I have a nice camera setup. It seems like a nice family activity taking pictures of the family in nature, since we are outdoors so much. ""
B: ""The kids must love it. I think given the time I spend in nature myself that would be a good hobby to pick up. Not when mountain biking but hiking.""
A: ""The cherry trees started to blossom in the park and I got some really beautiful pictures! ""

A: ""Yes, we go there pretty often. But we like to switch it up, so we usually try to pick a different park each weekend. Yes, my wife has all the pictures on her phone, but I'll send them to you as soon as she sends them to me!""
B: ""That would be wonderful, thank you! I am so jealous of your weekend family outings. I try so hard to get my dad to come out and he never will.""
A: ""Are your parents together, if you don't mind me asking? If so, maybe he could go with you to the cherry blossom festival, I think it starts in a few days.

A: ""My husband is gone a lot, what kind of music?""
B: ""Rock! I hope to make it big! I pay the piano and guitar.""
A: ""That is so cool, our daughter plays sax.""
B: ""Awesome! Does she sing too? I sing!""
A: ""No, she does not. Our oldest son tries to sing.""
B: ""Are you supportive of her dream? My parents are not.""
A: ""I am supportive of them all, even my husbands quest to find his biological parents.""
B: ""Oh he is adopted? How nice!""
A: ""He is. He is a detective, I'm very proud of him and our kids.""
B: ""Law enforcement work is respectable work. You should be proud!""
A: ""Do you have any hobbies? I like those adult coloring books.""
B: ""Just playing the guitar, piano and singing. I like to color too!""
A: ""My husband has signed up for a company that helps people to find lost family. He's really excited.""
B: ""That sounds great. Has he ever looked for his biological family?""
A: ""He's always talked of doing it, but this time he's actually gonna go for it. I'm excited for him.""
B: ""Good for him. I would imagine he is a little nervous about it?""
A: ""Yeah, he's really nervous if he finds them, they wont want to have anything to do with him;""
B: ""I could only imagine that would be challenging. I think it is great for him to try anyway. That way he gets answers. Does he have any information about them yet?""
A: ""He has a couple of pieces of information about two brothers!""
B: ""Hey, that is cool information for him to know. I wonder if his brothers know he is out there. You will have to keep me posted! ""
A: ""Oh I def will! I really hope it turns out that they are open to him and we can become a big family ""
B: ""Do your kids know he is adopted? Are they aware of the search he is about to embark on?""
A: ""My husband has already got some new information on his family, it was so quick! ""
B: ""Wow. Was he able to find his biological parent? that was quick""
A: ""Not yet, but with his handy detective skills, he is getting close! He thinks he may have a definitive answer by end of this week. ""
B: ""Aw that is amazing!! I know he is nervous, but he is a great man and I think it will go great. I hope so for his sake! ""
A: ""I hope so too! He reserved a spot for us at the Blues Brother lounge this Friday to celebrate the news. You should join us!""
B: ""I would love to! You already know I love me some music!!! I look forward to seeing yall. Will his brothers be there to? Have they met the parents?""

A: ""She probably isn't old enough to play in a lot of grown-up places, but I had a similar thought just yesterday! I thought since the weather is getting nice, maybe we could all meet at a park so you can jam.

B: ""With your husbands family situation I completely agree! My parents were never really supportive of me so it's great to see him reconnecting with his loved ones.""
A: ""Thank you. I just hope it all works out. He's waited for this for so long; I worry his expectations are inflated and the disappointment will be huge if things don't go well. ""
B: ""It's always nerve wrecking to feel outcasted and abandoned. I'm sure it'll go fine! They probably are just as excited as your husband. Will they introduce him to his biological parents?""
A: ""I think so. They definitely have information for us, but I'm not sure where it will lead. Luckily once my husband has names, he has resources at work to do a bit of checking around before deciding if he wants to meet them right away or not. I'm sorry your parents weren't supportive of you! ""
B: ""It's alright, It's part of life. It's always great to see someone has the opportunity to reconnect with their family! Yeah he should definitely do some research before, I agree.  If he decides they're a great fit you should bring them to our park meet up as well!""

B: ""You do have plenty of time to do the nursery. Do you have a nursery theme picked out? The weather here is a little humid but warm and manageable. ""

B: ""The nursery plans sounds great. You will have to send me pictures when it is done. My favorite thing to do in Florida is fish. It relaxes me. ""
A: ""Big fish?  Like Marlins?  Those look so fun to catch!!!""
B: ""I have yet to be that lucky. I fish close to shore. Small sharks and crazy looking fish with lots of teeth. ""

B: ""That doesnt sound very comfortable at all, is there anything the doctors or you can do to alleviate some of the symptoms?""

B: ""Oh yikes, I can only imagine how you must be feeling. I would take the professional advice and lay around--I'd probably do all my nest shopping right from my bed""
A: ""That is a great idea, actually! But then who will cook for my stepchildren? I don't want them to feel neglected, I want them to know they are just as much my children as these new babies will be,""
B: ""You can prevent that from making them feel involved in helping you! Just appreciate them and their help""
A: ""That is a great idea. I know they are super excited to have new siblings, so I should definitely get them involved in everything. Thank you for the great advice!""
B: ""Yes and it will teach them really valuable life skills, like compassion and maybe cooking if they are old enough""
A: ""I am getting more and more big with this pregnancy, it's crazy!""
B: ""I'll bet!  How far along are you now?""
A: ""About four and a half months! It is get close and I am nervous!""
B: ""You're only halfway through, or do they not expect you to make it to the full nine months?""
A: ""There is no way I will make it to the full 9! And the nursery is nowhere near done!""
B: ""What do you have done so far?  I totally think you should add some fish in there somewhere!  I can send you pics of the ones I catch to get you started ;)""
A: ""I am not sure how the fish will go with the puppies, but do send them along! Right now is a bunch of pug wallpaper and that is it!!! I don't even have the crib together yet. ""
B: ""Or even better, you could add some cultural decorations.  I saw these amazing nursery displays when I was in Paris.  You could totally work that in with pugs.  All the French people have small, designer dogs, haha.""
A: ""You really are always full of great ideas! Maybe I can make the nursery a mini Paris in Japan! How adorable! You really do make me feel better about it all...even as I lay here like a beached whale in my bed.""
B: ""Oh honey!  Has your husband cooked you anything good lately?  He's not making you do all the cooking now is he?""
A: ""He passed away recently. It is just me and the step kids. They are great, but it is so odd to be in a new place with his kids running around and his kids growing in my belly. He sure left a legacy.""

B: ""I like pineapple on a pizza. Because sometimes you need a little bit of sweet to go with your savory. Also in honor of the fine state of Hawaii.""
A: ""Yes exactly, I think that's why salted caramel works so well. The salty tang brings the savory but then the caramel brings the sweet. If I was a better cook I'd try to bake myself some salted caramel cookies. Have you ever baked any?""
B: ""I've never made salted caramel cookies. I think you've found my limit. A good rule is generally the unhealthier the tastier, but something about salted caramel is a bit too far for me. Any other favourite dishes?""
A: ""Well I can only imagine they'd be really difficult to make. It always seems that way, no matter how healthy you want to be the unhealthy items taste so much better, that's why I love pizza so much! Well, I haven't really had much luck with cooking in the past, so it's difficult to say as my food is terrible. I would love to be able to cook a tasty BBQ Rib that just falls off the bone. How about you?""
B: ""That sounds beautiful. I love italian cuisine. Just a simple traditional pasta dish cooked with good ingredients can be wonderful.""

It would be amazing to travel to Italy and try their best Pizza. I can only imagine it would contain the best mozzarella and the most amazing tomato sauce. Italian's put so much love into their food, don't you think?""
B: ""I actually visited Italy a few years ago and it was incredible. Each region has it's own dishes, the Florentine food so different to the Roman. Nothing like the Italian restaurants at home.""
A: ""Talking about salted caramels inspired me to try making some myself! I picked up the ingredients and will try making them tomorrow. ""
B: ""You should surely try them even if i don't like it, many of my friends love these.""
A: ""Yea my friends love them too and I going to try to make that for them. So did you finish watching the drug cartel show?""
B: ""I am mid way of the show  and it has already hyped me up. Are you singing any good raps for Charlie?""
A: ""Drug cartel shows are really interesting as most of them are true stories, which is why I am thinking of watching one too soon. LOL!!! I try my best to sing some for Charlie and myself. But may be you could help me by introducing me to some Somalian Rap one day!""
B: ""I would love to introduce Somalian rap as I listen to them often and I'm pretty sure you will rock on with your twist to it.""
A: ""Well most of the rap music that I produce or sing, have a mixture of rap lyrics and tunes from other cultures. I was listening to a cover of one Somalian rapper the other day and it had an awesome vibe. Also I feel the tunes in them liven you up and gets rid of all the stress in my opinion. Don't you think that's true?""
B: ""Exactly! I think the same and that's the only reason I am driven towards the Somalian rap as it helps me to stress out all my work pressure. And so does my cooking, all for my relaxation.""
A: ""Some say rap music helps cure depression and other mental issues. So no wonder I too love listening to music just relieve my stress or just relax for the day. Are there a lot of famous Somalian rappers in Somalia or in the US?""

B: ""That makes sense, how nice that you get to see him so often. Does your mother live there too?""
A: ""No, she passed away a few years ago. It's just me and my dad, now. How about you? Are your parents still alive? ""
B: ""Yes, they are both still alive. I am actually staying with them while I search for a job.""
A: ""That sounds good. Saving money. I wish I could save money, but I have to pay support to my ex. I'm not sure why, since she was the one who left me, but it's the law, I guess. How is the job hunting going? Anything on the horizon?""
B: ""I am struggling to find something I will enjoy but I will likely need to accept a job soon so I can keep paying bills. I am sorry to hear that you are having to pay your ex, does that mean your divorce is final now?""
A: ""We're still working things out. We're using a mediator, since we don't want to pay lawyers fees, which are huge! Yeah, sometimes you just have to take what's available, job wise. What do you think would be a tolerable job? ""
B: ""I'd really love a job designing video games, that would be a dream job but if I could do something with marketing or content creation, I would be okay for now. Do you enjoy working at the nursing home?""
A: ""That sounds like a good plan. Just getting your foot in the door with a video game company might be a good start. Are there companies like that near where you live, or would you be willing to move? The nursing home job is good. I've been doing it for 10 years, so I've learned how to deal with the less than fun stuff!""
B: ""There are no companies like that around me so I would need to move or work remotely since it is all computer work. ""
A: ""How is your job searching going? Have you been able to accept a job yet?""
B: ""It's still pretty sparse. I can't seem to find anything that interests me enough or at least pays enough to make it interesting. How's the mediating going?""
A: ""Hope things turn around for you soon. The mediating is going about as well as trying to teach a fish to wear pants and walk on land. It is frustrating. ""
B: ""Haha! I'm sorry to hear that though. That does sound frustrating. Hopefully we both get what we want soon. I need to afford a vacation!""
A: ""I can agree with that. I was on Facebook the other day and watching some workout videos because I want to be happy and getting healthy is the first step.  Have you thought about maybe doing some of those video game live videos on there? ""
B: ""That's a great idea! I need to put down the video games at times and get a workout in. I bet I would feel so much better overall. I've streamed a few times but it is so hard to really get noticed and get enough subscribers to warrant ads so that I can make money off of it. I might need to think about moving closer to a big city to get some tech opportunities.""
A: ""I would love a workout partner. We could video chat and workout together, keep each other motivated. You should look into company's that offer apprenticeships and then it would give you better idea of where you would need to move. ""
B: ""I am down for that! Let's schedule a time each day so that we can hold each other accountable. Do you know any programs we should start with? I'd like to see what I'm getting into! Haha! Good idea on checking for apprenticeships or internships. I need to start somewhere.""
A: ""Awesome!! yeah actually I just started doing a simple low carb high protein meal plan with links to workout videos and stuff.  I can email it to you if you want.   ""
B: ""Yes please! I'm a pretty picky eater but I need to make some changes. My parents are going to wonder what I've gotten into when I start working out! Haha!""
A: ""HAHAH!! Really mess with them when they begin giving you weird looks and tell them you were abducted by aliens and you are the new and improved son! HAHAHAHHA LMAO!!""
B: ""Hope they don't call the cops! Haha! I'm going to go with the hard core 80's look and get some striped high socks with wristbands and a sweatband! It's already going to be tough but might as well have fun!""

B: ""Pretty advanced for your age. Awesome.""
A: ""Do you think you could recommend me a book that is similar to the lord of the flies?""

A: ""Its a allegorical novel. About a bunch of kids stranded on an island and they have to basically form their own society.""
B: ""I don't think I can offer much help on that. I can recommend a great movie...Goonies!""
A: ""Goonies is a great movie. It was kind of like the kid version of Scooby doo, without the dog.""

A: ""I love Disney Movies, all of them. Micky is my favorite character.""

B: ""i do not remember the name but it was about a murder in north carolina. very interesting""
A: ""Interesting! I would love to read true crime, but my parents say I am not old enough yet. What age would you say is appropriate to read that book?""
B: ""when you have your 16th birthday""
A: ""Wow, that's more than 6 years away! I think I am mature for my age, maybe I will start to read some of those books in secret! What do you think?""
B: ""you seem like a very mature 10 year old which is a good thing""
A: ""Yes, I started reading novels when I was 4 years old. The teachers told my parents that they think I should skip a couple of grades. I don't want to leave my friends though, and the older kids scare me.""
B: ""older kids are scary until you realize you will also be them one day. then they are less scary""
A: ""That is a good way to think of things. My mom says that she used to think that too, and now 12 year olds seem like babies to her.""
B: ""everybody gets older and less scared of the world""
A: ""I did read a crime novel that my parents' read first and said wasn't too scary. It still kept me up almost all night! I'm working on doing what you said and becoming less afraid of the world, it's hard sometimes though.""
B: ""That is great effort! It is hard, but it will be worth the effort.  Have you tried imagining the scary things in a funny way?""
A: ""Yes, like imagining ketchup sauce for the blood? How?""
B: ""I used to believe there was a monster in my closet.  Then, I kept imagining it in a tutu and singing in a baby voice.  Then it became fun to imagine it, and I wasn't scared anymore.""
A: ""Now that's a tip I can also use for the high rollercoasters at Disney World too, when my stomach turns upside down!""
B: ""Maybe you can imagine that you are a jet fighter! Just don't eat lunch right before the ride! Is your family going to Disney World soon?""

A: ""This sounds amazing. I would really appreciate that as I don't have a lot to spend on my travels and, as you know, that area is NOT cheap. Could I ride into LA with you some time? I would love to check out a music studio!""
B: ""Sure!  I'll have to check with whoever is recording that day and make sure that they don't mind, but honestly, they don't usually care.  Sometimes the managers get a little fussy, but if it's someone new, they won't even know that you don't work there.""
A: ""Maybe you all can turn me into a folk fan! I imagine fold musicians are very chill. Maybe I can try painting a little while I am there, or would that be distracting. Could produce some cool artwork and I am quiet!""
B: ""That would be so cool!  If you're able to capture the artist, maybe we can get them to buy your work for their album cover!  They love to find new talent, and it can lead into some great opportunities.""
A: ""Oh my goodness. My heart just skipped a beat! That would be incredible. A dream come true, really. I would kill to be able to quit my job and just paint.""
B: ""Hey, maybe you could move out here and I can go spend some time in your home state!  I need to get out of California for a while.""
A: ""It is my dream to move there. In the meantime, you are more than welcome to come to Texas! We can go see some real country concerts! Bring your wife!""
B: ""That would be great.  I'm sure she would love to get away as well.  She's been missing the country, all that fresh air and those hard working people.""

B: ""Family/divorce lawyer. So many times growing up seeing people get taken to the cleaners when they didn't deserve it. Not having enough visitation time with their kids makes me want to go the extra mile so they get what they deserve.""
A: ""I bet that will be a very rewarding career to be able to help people in that situation!  How much longer do you have until you can take your final exams?""
B: ""I have 2 months left be fore finals and then the bar. After that I have an internship through a local office. As a stunt double what's the worst accident you've had?""
A: ""Luckily I haven't had anything too serious.  Just some scrapes and bumps and bruises!  I've seen some people get pretty hurt though and then their career is over for good.  I think that's where my martial arts training comes in handy because I know a lot of tricks for minimizing impact.  So do you get paid for your internship or do you not start getting paid until you're done with that?  ""
B: ""Thats good, i've seen YouTube videos of martial arts trainers that would punch and kick trees or hard surfaces to strengthen their bones. Some don't but I was fortunate enough to find this one that does. It's not like full time job pay scale but better than working for free.""
A: ""At least it's something!  I'm sure those student loan lenders will be hunting you down as soon as you graduate wanting paid back!!  I'd imagine all those years of college have not been cheap!  That's one thing that led me into a career path that didn't involve years of schooling!""
B: ""Yes schooling is never cheap and it was a hard decision to apply for school loans. I know in the long run i will make more than enough to pay it off, but it will be rough times for a bit. Ramen noodle rough times. Speaking of food what are you restricted to with your diet?""
A: ""When do you plan open your own lawyer office?""
B: ""Oh I still need quite a bit of time. I'm thinking after I pay my student loans and get some experience through internships.""
A: ""That makes sense. How long will the internship last?""
B: ""Seven months, but we will see how it goes. What did you learn in school?""
A: ""Not a whole lot. I went into martial arts pretty soon after high school and most of what I learned in high school has not been very useful in my career. If I went to college, I probably would have studied physical therapy or something like that.""
B: ""That's amazing. Do you enjoy working as a stunt double?""
A: ""It's a lot of fun! I've had the chance to meet a lot of really cool and interesting people. Some actors are a lot more chill than others. I met Ryan Reynolds on the set of Deadpool and he was a really awesome guy""
B: ""I could imagine. You're very lucky to have met Ryan Reynolds, that would be a dream come true for me.""
A: ""It was quite honestly one of the best experiences in my life. I was only on set for one day but still amazing. I'm sure you'll end up with some crazy work stories from doing family/divorce law!""
B: ""Haha yes I actually look forward to that. I will be sure to tell you if I do.""
A: ""I look forward to it! Are you ready to be done with school? These last two months must be brutal.""
B: ""Very much so, but very worth it and very important. But I am very excited for the next chapter of my life.""
A: ""I just got contacted about working as a stunt double for the newest Deadpool movie!""
B: ""Congratulations!! I really enjoyed those films. They are funny as anything. Does a lot of planning go into doing stunt work?""
A: ""Ehhh...there is a lot, what with bureaucracy and burn gel and whatnot, but you get a bit of a pattern to it after a while.""
B: ""Your martial arts training should definitely help with the stunt work. It's so cool that you get to meet Ryan Reynolds. Are you a fan of his other movies?""
A: ""Yeah. Anything with National Lampoon in it is solid. The first Deadpool kept it real, which is more than I can say of modern churnouts like Wonder Woman.""
B: ""The Marvel cinematic universe definitely is better than what DC has churned out. Justice League was a disaster and I actually fell asleep watching it. ""
A: ""Quite true. Any similarities between the films and the legal world? I hear you're graduating soon. Ready for office politics and the like?""
B: ""Yes Im ready to dive into a storm of red tape and regulations. The only similarities is that both industries can be cutthroat at times. ""
A: ""Especially since you're going into divorce law? Guess the confidentiality agreements will lose you sleep.""
B: ""I see it not as an ending but as a way for two people to continue on their life without legal complications hindering their personal growth and enjoyment. ""

A: ""We moved in together just about a year ago.  I moved in with him which was about 3 hours away.  That's why I no longer teach gym.  I spend most of my days just grilling and volunteering.  It's been fun but I definitely miss the kids; I""
B: ""Have you looked for gym teaching jobs where you are now? Is it something you'd like to do again?""
A: ""I think I'd like to look for something just part-time; maybe even if I could find a preschool or something to take up just a small part of the day.  Plus that always ended up being my own exercise for the day, haha! Grilling and eating don't make for a very active lifestyle.  What's your favorite subject to teach the kids?""
B: ""That sounds good, I think you should 100% have a look! I like teaching science, especially nature subjects""
A: ""Ah I bet the kids love those subjects too, I always remember loving getting outside for lessons like that.  Do you teach them Spanish and French too?""
B: ""Yeah they do, I think that's also part of the reason I enjoy it, it's great to see them really engage with a subject! We do a little bit of Spanish and French, not a lot in the age group I teach, just the very basics to get them started. ""

A: ""Yah it's nice, since I'm not working at the moment feels nice to have something to do that's useful to others.""

A: ""Oh, I agree with you on all of that. She even tried to fool her husband and faked a pregnancy!! Talk about planning ahead. Sheesh.""
B: ""Well she's not completely crazy then I guess! Maybe the fooled pregnancy was the reason for the crime in the first place... ""I need a baby or he'll know I was faking!""""

A: ""It is complicated but i have a passion to learn. How quickly do you think i will be an acceptable cook if i put a lot of effort into it?""
B: ""One thing I learned about passion is that it takes more than that to do anything. I worked in construction, taught by my dad, and I succeed intill my work ethic surpassed my passion. For cooking you have to get out of your comfort zone and work hard. If you work hard you will have acceptable cooking in a matter of days , maybe even weeks.""
A: ""Cooking is cool, but construction is even cooler. Do you build from group up, or do you do smaller jobs?""

B: ""Yeah, lol. I'm sure the sunrises look great with all the open spaces in Egypt. I'd love to travel there some day, but that's enough about me. How are things with you and your girlfriend? It's your anniversary today, right? ""
A: ""Things with my girlfriend are great. Leading up to my anniversary I feel somewhat at peace and contented. At least my parents aren't questioning my choices, and my publicly LGBT lifestyle isn't attracting too many trolls!""
B: ""Lucky! I'm glad things are going so well with you. You two make a lovely couple, I'm jealous <3""
A: ""Ehhh... my middle school's students are kinda nosy when my wife comes in for guest lessons.""

A: ""Oh cool! Parents proud of you for going to college? I know mine aren't too excited.""
B: ""Not really. I've been arguing with them for weeks trying to get the information I need for FAFSA and applications. Nothing out of the usual but that doesn't make it hurt any less.""
A: ""So sad to hear that. And even worse, I would think is that ex-boyfriend of yours! Have you tried venting to your pet fish?""
B: ""Well as great as Finley is, I'm pretty sure the yelling is stressing them out. Betas aren't exactly the most sturdy, but I love the little swimmer. ""

A: ""Dad is military, mom is dead and I'm tracy. Hi!""
B: ""H hey buddy, spare some change? Oh I got the shakes lad.""
A: ""Sorry no change. I'm former pole dancer. Now I work for social security.""
B: ""Burp oh is that so? Do you preform on sidewalks by chance?""
A: ""No sidewalks. Mom said soup is good for the shakes before she died.""
B: ""I left me farm life behind, live in the city now.""
A: ""Great! Dads platoon volunteered to go help in puerto rico. You dance?""
B: ""D does shaking count as dancing? Oh man.. I need a drink.""
A: ""No shaking isn't dancing. I got fired trying to teach a pig to dance.""
B: ""Teaching dancing to inanimate objects was my profession. I live in a box.""
A: ""Home is where the box is. Boiled pig skin is good for alcohol shakes.""
B: ""P pig skins are monitored by the illuminati. They want to take away our booze.""
A: ""You sure? You have box insurance? You should because its your home.""
B: ""Is vomit stains insurance? It seems to keep everyone away.""
A: ""My dad made my mom football soup before died of the shakes.""
B: ""I'm 45! My mom is dead. Darn you illuminati!""
A: ""I might start pole dancing again.""
B: ""Wow that sounds like a big change back. What brought that up?""
A: ""I decided that I want to be my old self.""
B: ""Sometimes you do just have to go with what you think will make you happy. Im still struggling with that.""
A: ""Really? Tell me about your problems.""
B: ""Well im still homeless, i havent gotten over my moms death, and i just cant give up the booze.""
A: ""That's tough. Just remember to keep on going and it will all work out.""
B: ""You are right but its tough. Maybe i should get out of the city and move back to the country. Open up a dancing studio.""
A: ""Yeah that is a pretty smart idea.""
B: ""I just have to figure out a way to make the money. Im sure if i could find the support to stop drinking that would be a good start.""
A: ""True, best of luck with that.""
B: ""Thank you and i hope your new career works out too! Are you still keeping in touch with your dad?""
A: ""What did you do before you became homeless?""
B: ""I was living with my wife on my old family farm, but we have split up because of my mental health. ""
A: ""Yeah and in this country mental health issues get pushed way down on the things people actively care about helping""
B: ""It can be hard to get out of a hole once you are so far down into it. It's hard to find help""
A: ""I'd say it's damn near impossible. There's the lack of money, the stigma associated with it, the distrust of others, etc... It's an absolute pit and very few people actually want to help people out of it""
B: ""I don't hold other people responsible for my actions and I don't expect people to help me. It's hard to find help sure, but I accept that I am responsible for myself, not other people.""
A: ""I'd feel the opposite. Mental issues are completely out of your control yet you are saddled with them regardless. I think it would do us all a world of good if there were more help out there to alleviate things that are completely out of our control""
B: ""They are not completely out of my own control. I choose to be homeless and the fact that there are not more people to help is not any one persons fault. I could get any job, but I choose to be picky so I can hold out for a better one.""
A: ""Maybe thats true, but  there is also the issue that your brain is not functioning like a normal person's brain so it literally tells you to go against yourself. It's telling you that you deserve to be homeless because certain cognitive functions are wired incorrectly and tell you the opposite of what other peoples brains tell them""
B: ""No it is not and I find it absurd that someone else is insisting to me how my own brain works---or rather that it doesn't work, simply because I am choosing to be homeless. You don't know me, don't act like you do or you are some armchair psychologist""
A: ""Maybe that's true as well...just get help any way you can""
B: ""Thank you I will. Have you spoken with your dad recently?""
A: ""I cleaned out my pantry last week and I have lots of canned goods I need to get rid of. You're welcome to have them if you want.""
B: ""that would be great! that will really help me save some money so I can hopefully find a place to live soon.""
A: ""Yes. finding a place to live I'm sure is at the top of your list. Are you working with a program or on your own?""
B: ""I'm working on my own right now.  Do you know of any programs that can help me?""
A: ""Working with social security we often have to assist our clients who can't make it just on their SSI and need additional assistance. I think the best programs are there. Every town has an office. Stop in and I am sure they will help you.""
B: ""thank you so much, that will really help.  How's your father doing?""
A: ""My father is a workaholic. He's doing well, but I wish I got to see him more. How about you? Is your dad in the area?""
B: ""I don't know where he is.  He doesn't want to talk to me.  He's embarrassed about my situation.""

B: ""I'm sure he'll come around eventually.  I'm glad you're getting back into pole dancing.  I know how happy it makes you.""
A: ""What do you do that makes you smile?""

B: ""I'm glad you are recoverying well! I have an event scheduled in 2 weeks from this Friday. I am so excited. My buddy and I both race, we have a bet for this one. Have you ever ridden a motorcycle?""
A: ""No, I never have. My doctors didn't think it was a great idea because of all the surgeries. Maybe when I'm fully recovered I can ask again, because I'd love to try it. Where's your race going to be, anyplace fun?""
B: ""It will be in Birmingham, Alabama. The race track is called Barber Motorsports Park. It is a good drive for my buddy and I, we live in Tennessee. We will get there early and do some sight seeing. Have you ever been to Alabama?""
A: ""No, I never have. I've heard that it's really nice there. Do you race on dirt, or is it a paved track? Is it like I see on tv sometimes, with hills and jumps and all sorts of wildness? That looks like so much fun.""
B: ""this one is on pavement. If you cant ride a motorbike, maybe you should attend a race, It is really thrilling. What kind of hobbies do you have?""
A: ""Mostly indoor stuff like reading, cooking, decorating, things like that. When you have to hang out in the house a lot you get motivated to make it more pleasant! I'm looking forward to taking up more outdoor stuff like fishing and hiking and horseback riding. And maybe motorbiking!""
B: ""Do you ever grow the food you cook? Or do you have great farmer's markets in your area?""

B: ""Sounds great are there any good fishing spots in Pennsylvania? ""

B: ""Haha. I like your plan! It sounds almost fool-proof! Do you have a plan B?""
A: ""Animal control is the plan B but Frank is real particular about who touches his peacock.""
B: ""Yeah...I can understand that. Animal control tries their best, but they don't know animals like the ones who take care of the animal!""

B: ""Aww good. I am surprised he was ok with animal control getting involved. Was anyone or any animals hurt in the process?""
A: ""No, everyone was fine! It was best for the birds safety since it was in the road and could have gotten hit by a car!""
B: ""Thank goodness. I wonder how my cats would react if they saw a peacock outside. They probably would have caught it for you! LOL""
A: ""Oh no! Have they ever hurt a bird before? Or do they stay inside?""
B: ""They are indoor kitties but one (named Frank, actually!) liked to slip out. He has never brought me a bird, but a few adorable mice have met their demise when he escapes.""

B: ""Oh, it is everything! They are so much more loyal and trustworthy than humans. I wish I could foster dogs but the kitties would be very unhappy with me.""

B: ""The wild ones are fascinating, but you could save a little life if you adopted! Maybe get a herding dog that can safely scare off the peacock next time.""

A: ""I have 3 now. I would happily get more in a heartbeat. You should totally get one!!""
B: ""I'm think about it! What's the best part about having one?""
A: ""Just the unconditional love, really. They're always down to do whatever you want to do, whether it's high energy or taking a nap.""
B: ""That's sweet. Maybe i should start out with a small dog first and see how it goes. ""
A: ""They definitely require less exercise, but they can also live longer, so it can be a bigger commitment strangely!""
B: ""Good points. Smaller dogs do live longer. I would like to have a companion that gives me unconditional love!""

B: ""Do yours stay inside or are they outside dogs?""
A: ""any updates on your decision on getting a dog?""
B: ""I've been looking at breeds on youtube, trying to figure out if I'll get a breed dog, or a shelter dog maybe. Where did you get your dogs? ""
A: ""Shelter. So many shelter dogs out there and I can't stomach the fact that they get put down if no one takes them. A dog is the best companion there is""
B: ""Maybe could be a mix of both. I've learned that cats that are black at the shelter, get adopted less, due to superstition. Also need a breed that maybe doesn't need miles of walking a day. ""
A: ""I've heard that as well. Black cats are gorgeous though. I'm not sure what dog doesn't require that much walking as they are so energetic to begin with""
B: ""In my research, several breeds of dogs, especially smaller dogs, are less in need of physical exercise, than other breeds. Border collie for example, would pass on that, although loved one in the past. What are your dogs like?""

B: ""I appreciate your thoughts there. For my home and life, that would be too big. Medium or small size for this home! Wonder if they have smaller bred German shepherds. I'd consider that. ""

A: ""Yea he's great isn't he. I do like war movies, though I must admit occasionally they depress me a bit, especially if they are based on real situations where thousands of people were dying! But hey, it's important to know about those times in history. Do you like war movies?""

I mostly ride through woods and fields, I'm not into jumping very much although we jump over stuff on the trails.""
A: ""that sounds so adventorous! Do you ever take your horse out hunting, or is that even a thing?""
B: ""It's a thing, you can do either a ""live hunt"" where you're actually chasing after foxes/rabbits with dogs, or you can do a hunt that uses a scent bag that's dragged along and the dogs chase that, and then you follow the dogs.

B: ""I have not. I have watched them race though. I'm too heavy to be a jockey.""
A: ""I think it looks like a lot of fun! Especially the races where you have to jump but I guess that's pretty different to the kind of horse riding you like""
B: ""I like riding for the enjoyment. I like being friends with an animal and forming trust as a bond between the two of us. I live out in the Olympics and have tons of trails I can ride.""

B: ""Anywhere from a few hours to a couple days. Depends on what season it is and what is interesting.""
A: ""Oh wow that's so changeable, you must really love it. Do you just ride one horse?""
B: ""No the place that keeps them is a place that rents them out. I have two that I ride normally but there are others that periodically shuffle through. ""

A: ""A golden retriever, they are great for families, especially since I am having twins soon! ""
B: ""Oh i had a golden retriever growing up he was an amazing dog, great choice for a family. I bet your excited to adding two new additions to your family, do you know what your having yet?""
A: ""Yes! A boy and a girl. Im very excited. Has your girlfriend changed her mind about children? ""
B: ""That amazing congratulations to you and your whole family. No not yet, we are both very focused and busy with our careers right now maybe a few years down the line she will reconsider.""
A: ""What do you do for work? something in the music field? I know you said you're a big fan of music""
B: ""I actually do work in the music industry, i work for a music label and help create the backing music for the songs, its a very fun job to have. Music is my life for sure. Do you listen to anything other that jazz?""
A: ""Thats so awesome, I would love to hear sometime. I like a lot of music such as classical and even some old rock music. I couldn't imagine doing it for a career though. I am a accountant now. ""
B: ""Oh for sure i will send you a demo for one i did recently for a new artist we have just gotten. Thats cool i am in to all the genres of music but nothing beats sitting down will a glass of wine listening to a bit of classical. Yeah it defiantly no a job for everyone. I did someone course of accounting in college for extra credits it was good but musics my passion. How do you like being an accountant?""
A: ""I took my golden retriever for a long walk to the park. ""
B: ""How was it?! My childhood dog absolutely loved going for long walks""
A: ""It was good! We went to the new dog park and got to visit with neighbors and their puppers. Then we went to the sculpture park and watched birds.""
B: ""Aww. Sounds like a great day! I am sure your soon to be twins enjoyed the exercise. ""
A: ""Yes they did! They went from bouncing around and making me ill to calm and situated ready to pop into the world. I noticed that my dog also seemed to feel better about them because she wasnt watching my belly as much as she does on an off day.""
B: ""Isn't it amazing how animals can sense a pregnancy?! I am so happy to hear that you are doing well! Is your daughter excited to be a big ster?""
A: ""She is. She takes the dog to her room and practices taking care of a baby with the golden retreiver. Its so precious. ""
B: ""Awwww!!! That is so sweet!!! Have you been playing a specific genre of music for the baby?""
A: ""No I dont believe in that. I think that I should be the one to actively try to calm and stimulate myself in a beneficial way so I dont have so many stress hormones involved in the pregnancy. I do listen to some classical but I prefer jazz. Plus if they cath it while theyre in there maybe the polyrithms will be beneficially stimulating.""
B: ""I have heard that classical music is very calming! I admire your desire to actively calm your stress hormones. Have you take part in any mediation groups?""
A: ""I go to yoga and I do my own mindfulness with the Calm App.""
B: ""How do you like that app? I have always been a fan of headspace, but have heard good things about calm!""
A: ""The most adorable thing happened. My daughter put a bonnet and bib on the dog and fed it dog food with a tiny spoon. I guess she is getting prepared for her new siblings! I'm glad I have such a patient dog. haha""
B: ""Aw that is so cute! Are you getting super excited for the babies to arrive now?""
A: ""I really am! I've been working on getting the nursery room ready, and really watching the ads for diaper coupons, LOL!""
B: ""Haha! What colour did you paint the nursery since you're having one of each?""
A: ""You are intuitive! I can't believe how easy I thought it would be to choose.  After taking home about 50 samples, I picked a deep sunflower.  ""
B: ""Aw yellow is lovely and quite gender neutral as well!!! Have you been thinking about names?""
A: ""I have, but haven't really decided.  How about some suggestions? Favorite musicians, maybe?""
B: ""Oh I'm useless at stuff like that! My last dog was called Spot because I couldn't think of anything more imaginative lol""
A: ""Hah! That sounds like me.  The first names that come to mind are usually generic.  Maybe I need to listen to some more music for insipiration.""
B: ""Maybe - sometimes generic names can be  good though, sometimes standing out with a unique name can make you stand out too much""
A: ""I agree on that point.  I want to make sure the kids can choose who they want to be, not stuck into a category because of a name.""
B: ""Exactly - but also kids grow into their names so I'm sure whatever you pick for them will be great""

B: ""I teach elementary school. What do you do?""
A: ""Do you teach the same grade as either of your parents?""
B: ""Yes! I teach the 3rd grade, but I've been considering going to older grades. Just how diverse is your music taste? ""
A: ""I enjoy everything from classical to heavy metal! I am not familiar with up but they are probably great. have you seen them in concert?""
B: ""That is pretty diverse. I have seen them in concert, they're one of those bands that sounds just as good in person, I can't wait to go to more! I think you'd like them, considering your music taste. How is your studies going? ""
A: ""If they are performing near me, i will try to see their show! My studies are going well and I am working on my thesis. What is your favorite subject to teach? ""
B: ""What is your thesis covering? I love teaching all subjects, but I'd have to say I love teaching reading the most. ""
A: ""I am writing about non-verbal communications. Its probably something you could use with your students! Kids are great at communicating without words. I agree that reading is a great subject. I read a lot of science journals. What do you have your students read? ""
B: ""Well, besides their textbooks, I have a little reading area with nonfiction and fiction books. I let them choose, and they seem to gravitate toward fictional fairy tales and sci-fi far more than factual writings, but that's normal. What type of science journals do you read? You're very intellectually stimulating to talk to!""
A: ""I just read this really interesting scientific article on non-verbal communication between teachers and students that I'm thinking of including in my thesis.""
B: ""That sounds so intriguing! Would you want to possibly observe one of my elementary school classes sometime?""
A: ""If possible! We would have to send out consent forms, if that's okay?!""
B: ""That is completely fine! I love my students, and I think they genuinely love learning.""
A: ""I will send you an email next week with a formal plan. Thanks for helping! What is the most popular board game among your classes?""
B: ""They really like to play Dominoes if that counts!""
A: ""To be honest, I don't think dominoes counts as a board game. It is fun though! Any other ideas?""
B: ""The other board game they really love is chutes and ladders.""
A: ""Oh my goodness! I used to love that game as a kid! I am glad to hear you are sharing it with the younger generation. Do they complain about not having a computer screen to play on?""
B: ""No! I am actually so surprised they enjoy the actual physical board being there!""
A: ""I love it!! That is great to hear!! I always worry that too much of the younger generation is attached to technology.""
B: ""Yeah, I definitely try to avoid screens in the classroom. I want to make sure the students are focused and alert while class is in session.""
A: ""I just complete my thesis. The scientific article really help that.""
B: ""Congratulations!! How long does it take to get the thesis approved and receive your PhD?""
A: ""Well usually it takes about a year and a half to finalize the thesis with the help of peer review and mentor review. What sort of books do you encourage your 3rd graders to read?""
B: ""Charlottes Web and books by Judy Blume are easily digested at that age. Those books also are great for giving subtle life lessons. What books do you enjoy?""
A: ""I enjoy autobiographies during my leisure time and delve into science journals more often. Do you think kids should read more non-fiction than fictional books from an early age?""
B: ""That's a great question. I think because children at that age have rapidly expanding minds, the fantastical is often given to push boundaries of imagination. A lot of non-fiction books can be quite dense, even those aimed at younger readers. ""
A: ""Well that's true non-fiction books can dense and dry for young minds. Although do you think books help kids in developing non-verbal communications?""
B: ""I think they are great in laying the foundation for critical thought and creativity. To start question how the world functions and the dynamics of social relationships, if only at a surface level.""
A: ""Well creativity is what young kids master very early considering all the different media at their disposal. That's why schools and teachers like you have a hard time making them understand the facts of the present world and rightly said ""the dynamics of social relationships"". It must be real tough time for you to control their ever-expanding imaginations right?!?""

B: ""Absolutely, if you enjoy the beach and can find the time. ""
A: ""I only like beaches when the weather is really warm, so I'll have to check the forecast and play it by ear.  Is there anything else in the area you'd recommend?""

A: ""I have never been tubing before and I just took up snowboarding a few years ago. Do you miss the Canadian winters or were they too brutal?""
B: ""They can be pretty brutal! If you ever get the chance try tubing out, it'll make up for the cold weather! I definitely miss the winters but I enjoy the beach so much I feel like it's a fair trade off!""
A: ""I love being by the beach. As I get older, the winters are harder on my bones and skin. I just want to get away to a tropical paradise. ""
B: ""Haha that's fair enough! I definitely agree the tropical paradise is visually more appealing than the snow at times! Sometimes the snow just makes a brown muck when you're in the city and its not as nice as a beachy paradise!""

A: ""I have! I remember the ones we used to go visit and take care of were fans of large inflatable balls. They like to kick them and bite them and roll them around.""
B: ""Really? That's wonderful! Thank you so much for the idea, I'll definitely try that with them. How are your children doing?""
A: ""They are doing fine. Were actually getting ready for their first visit to the horse ranch. Theyre so excited about their new clothes and shoes.""
B: ""I'm sure they are! They'll have so much fun. It must be nice to get outside finally after spending a lot of time inside. ""

B: ""That's so adorable. Is the ranch far from you?""

B: ""I've never been! I rarely travel because of the farm. My parents offered to take care of everything if I do decide to drive to California with a few of my friends, so the horses would stay on the farm.""
A: ""Have you bought the inflatable balls for your horses yet?  If so, are your horses enjoying playing with them?""
B: ""Yes! We went and bought a few different colors and sizes just to see what they liked. Most of them are loving it but a couple just canter off like they are annoyed by them.""
A: ""Yeah it usually varies but glad to hear you've already purchased some. How many horses you have in total by the way and what's their average age?""
B: ""We have 5 total ranging from a 1 year old up to a 7 year old. Speaking of horses.. how did your horse ranch visit go? Did the kids love it?""
A: ""Oh that's great. Yes, we did and we're actually planning to come back next month. Rachel my oldest who's 9 enjoyed them quite a bit, actually reminded me when I was young and I was excited to be around horses""
B: ""Oh I remember being a child and wanting horses! My dad always said I Could have one in 3 weeks. Then three weeks would go by and I would ask again and he would say in 3 weeks.. and that kept on for 3 years until all of a sudden I had one and then several within a couple months!""
A: ""Oh that's a bit sad to hear but I'm happy how it turned around. Three is the lucky number then! Rachel said as well ""Mommy can we have a horse pretty please?"". I don't want to be the bad cop, but also don't want to deceive her so I told her that was not an option but we compromised on visiting the ranch more often and I think that's a win-win for everyone""
B: ""It must have been hard going to the horse ranch carrying twins though. I couldn't imagine even wanting to move at all while being pregnant. How far along are you now?""
A: ""16 weeks! So is still very manageable. For obvious reasons didn't ride the horse or took part of some of the ranch activities, but otherwise I didn't have any problem with the long walks. Do you any plans with growing a family in the future or is the farm taking too much of your time these days?""
B: ""Right now the farm takes so much time from me that I'm not sure if it would be selfish to start a family. I don't think I'd have enough time to be the proper parent I should be so I'm on the fence. I barely get to leave the farm as it is and certainly no longer than a couple of hours or so.""
A: ""Yes, I can understand. I was the same way before. There are some trade-offs in life that one needs to make. But hey, you do you, and as long as what you're doing brings you happiness then why bother!""

I started practicing for years and years. WIth telekinesis it takes time, but it is a crazy ability to have.""
A: ""It's an awesome ability to have. With some training you could become an actual super hero that fights crime. How often do you meditate? ""

A: ""I have never been to the Austrian Alps, but I have heard of them! Can you tell me more about it? I'm sure it's beautiful!""
B: ""Well the Alps themselves stretch across parts of France, Switzerland, Austria and Italy. Once of the most famous places is probably Chamonix in France, as that's where Mont Blanc is (they highest mountain in Europe). It's also a really famous place for skiing, though I've never been skiing before. Have you?""
A: ""Wow! Sounds much more extensive than I initially thought! What do you do when you visit there? I love skiing, yes. It can be challenging at first, but it really is a lot of fun once you get enough practice in. I used to ski a lot when I was a teenager. ""
B: ""The few times I've been to the Alps we've visited various towns and gone on excursions to glaciers and ice caves and all sorts. I wish I had tried skiing when I was a bit younger, I'm worried about hurting myself now! Though I'm sure I'd be ok if I took it slowly. Would I need to buy all the skiing gear before going or can you hire it when you're there?""
A: ""You can rent all of the skiing gear when you go, so don't even worry about buying any. That way you aren't wasting your money if you end up not liking it and never want to ski again. Just take your time and practice, practice, practice. Don't feel pressured to go down the larger hills at first. You'll get there eventually. ""
B: ""That's really useful to know, thank you. I was a bit worried about spending lots of money if I only used it once! I'll have a think about whether I can get a ski trip in over the next couple of years; I should really add it to my bucket list. And I will avoid the larger hills at first; someone I know was forced by their brother to go down a tricky one almost immediately and he had a bad crash!""
A: ""Oh no! Were they okay? Or did they get hurt? I have heard many horror stories about skiing accidents- lots of broken bones and even death sometimes. Being careful is so incredibly important. Safety first! ""
B: ""Safety first for sure! Miraculously they didn't break anything but they were very bruised. Their brother felt awful for ages afterwards!""
A: ""I'm glad they were okay. Wow, I'm sure that was very scary for them. I can't wait to hear how your skiing trip goes in the next few years! You're going to love it. I just know it. And if not, at least you'll be seeing some beautiful scenery. ""
B: ""Haha that's true, at the very least I'll be able to be up in the mountains (and enjoy a beer at the lodge in the evening)! I'll have to start planning both a skiing trip and my trip to Alaska!""

"Based on the following dialogue:
A: ""Hi there how are you?""
B: ""Hello! I'm good. I just came inside from tending to my fields.""
A: ""Nice got to keep an eye on your crops, too bad I like more burgers and fries""
B: ""Ironically, I don't like the food I plant. I prefer pizza.""
A: ""Lol well I do like walks so I'd walk the fields any day""
B: ""My father hates that I don't like the food we plant, as he's a farmer.""
A: ""Lol if it wasn't for my boyfriend who stays here I'd eat burgers everyday""
B: ""Do you like music? I love rock music and listen to it while I work!""
A: ""Yes I like latin music mostly or some hip hop""
B: ""It is funny that my arabian horses, that I've three of by the way, love it.""
A: ""Really that is awesome how long have you had them""
B: ""Three years. They're my favorite ones to ride. More fun than driving a car!""
A: ""I bet your but doesn't get sore lol""
B: ""I bought a comfortable saddle online not too long ago, but you are right.""
A: ""Nice well if you ride them alot it must be worth every penny""
B: ""I wish I could teach more people to learn to ride""
A: ""I was about to make a burger but my boyfriend came home early from work lol.""
B: ""What did your boyfriend want you to eat today?""
A: ""Just a salad, nothing else. Though I should say ex-boyfriend, since we finally broke up. Some friends have been showing me how abusive and controlling his rules about my food habits were, and I finally ended it.""
B: ""Oh wow are you still living together with your boyfriend? I really like to eat a salad with fresh vegetables from my farm but it could be topped with a burger and it would be a burger salad.""
A: ""No, I'm moving in with some friends for the short term and I'm gonna figure something out in the future. It's for the best though, I hadn't been attracted to him for a while, and I might actually ask out a girl I like a bit more, though I'm still shell shocked from this break up. And I think eating is about balance, you can have a burger one day and a salad the next.""
B: ""It is good to wait some time before moving on even though it sounds like you already knew it was time to end it. It must be hard to have to move though. Yes food can be delicious and healthy at the same time, I really like veggie burgers.""
A: ""Veggie burgers are great! These are the kind of options I wanted to be able to eat, and now I can. Relationship control is so hard to see until you get out of the relationship. It is hard, but II have good friends who care about me. I will say that while I've always identified as bisexual, this relationship has really killed my interest in men. Maybe I'll start identifying as Lesbian going forward, because I doubt I'd date another man.""
B: ""There are so many options now with both vegan options and relationship status. You really don't have to identify as anything anymore just be you. As long as you are happy with yourself how you identify shouldn't matter. I took a seminar on equality the other day it was very interesting there were so many terms I wasn't even aware of in the LGBQT++ community""
A: ""Thank you, that really means a lot! It helps to hear that. How was the seminar? What did you learn?""
B: ""The seminar was about equality but it was put on by some members of the LGBQT community. It was very interesting learning about people's experiences. Things are changing with the new generation they no longer identify as attracted to one specific gender and in the future things will change people will like people for who they are not what they identify as. I also learned that it is easy to make people feel more comfortable buy putting unisex bathroom signs on single stall bathrooms so people don't have to decide if they are male or female.""
A: ""I decided to take your advice and hold off on asking that girl out, but we might still hang out and grab some coffee as friends! What do you think?""
B: ""I think thats a good idea, holding off a little while after a breakup is usually for the best! Take it slow! ""
A: ""It was a really bad break up too. I’m glad to have a friend like you. We out for pizza sometime. ""
B: ""Yeah definitely, I like pizza so that sounds good! I'm sorry it was so hard of a breakup. So this ""hangout"", is this your first time ""
A: ""Yes! Is feels right but I’m so confused. I don’t know ho we really feel. I really like her but it’s all so new to me. ""
B: ""How did you realize you're attached to girls?""
A: ""I think I always was, I was just scared to admit it. I didn’t want to put myself out there and felt I would be judged. I finally am starting to feel happy now though. ""
B: ""I am so happy for you and this new chapter of being happy! ""
A: ""You always made the best veggie burgers, I don’t want to pressure you but we should catch up and you should make those one day. Your farm has the best veggies. ""
B: ""Yes I will make a salad for us when we catch up, I love to use the veggies from the garden in salads! While you're over we should also go for a trail ride on my horses""
A: ""That sounds like a lot of fun. I would really like to ride your Arabian horses, they are so beautiful!""
B: ""Yes they are a prize, I love those guys! I wish we all still traveled by horse back than by car, I would be all over that! haha!""
A: ""I finally got the nerve to ask that girl out for coffee and she said yes!  ""
B: ""That's terrific! When are you going?""
A: ""Just to the Starbucks for now.  If things go well, will ask her to dinner""
B: ""Great. Does she like pizza? It might be a great first date if so.""
A: ""Not sure if she does, but you can be sure that I will ask!""
B: ""If she does, you should take her to lucali. Long wait to get to know each other and then that amazing pizza. ""
A: ""I love Lucali but have not been willing to wait as long as necessary.  They should really have beverage service will waiting.""
B: ""You can always brown bag some wine. Or a forty. I guess it depends on the date. When are you going for coffee?""
A: ""A forty is right up my alley and would be a good test of her humor.  If she can't appreciate a forty in a brown bag, I may have to reconsider.  We are going tomorrow night.""
B: ""Steel Reserve! If it ends as just a coffee date, hit me up after for drinks?""
A: ""For sure will do, but will cost you more than a forty.  I can really put down some bourbon, so buckle up.""
B: ""We can play Edward Fortyhands. That always goes well. ""

A: ""Haha I've never tried raw steak before! Maybe I'll look up a recipe. Would you like to watch a movie?""
B: ""That would be great.  What movie were you thinking?""
A: ""My favorite movie is 12 Angry Men. What's yours?""
B: ""I like comedies generally.  My favorite is probably Happy Gilmore.  I think Adam Sandler is hysterical.""

A: ""I am planning maybe next weekend to use it and I was going to look for someplace for Barnaby to go. That would be great if you could watch him for me! He loves when you take him on walks with your dogs. ""
B: ""Yeah definitely! I love dog walking and the more the merrier!  If it's okay with you, maybe I could take the group to the dog park?  Would Barnaby like that?""
A: ""Yeah Barnaby gets along with all kinds of dogs. Just make sure you watch out for scorpions! I can't stand those things, and Barnaby gets jumpy around them too. ""
B: ""Okay, I will be extra cautious about the scorpions! I've never had issues with them, but I know their venom can be really harmful.  In fact, if the song Rock You Like a Hurricane is playing at the park I'll turn right around and keep the dogs in the car.""

B: ""Ok you guys should definitely be ready by then. Is your goal to win it or just run in it?""
A: ""Oh, my goal is just to finish it!  My husband will probably try to get in the top 10, but for me it's just knowing that I did it the first time.""
B: ""That's a great goal! Have you ever thought about being vegan?""
A: ""Yes indeed.  I like having dairy in my diet, and use a lot of milk in the recipes I cook.  ""

A: ""I am a library aid, so I help the head librarian plan and run activities for various groups at the school along with regular library duties like checking out and shelving books. My favorite part of the job is helping the students with research; you learn so many interesting things.""
B: ""That sounds really nice. It is nice to make a difference. That's why I like human resources - to help people.""
A: ""I've always been pretty introverted, so at first having to interact with so many high-schoolers was intimidating, but now I find myself looking forward to them coming to me for help. I guess my love for helping people bloomed late; have you always been a people person?""
B: ""I think so. I used to visit my dad at Home Depot and watch him help everyone. I guess it rubbed off on me. I try to teach it to my kid.""
A: ""That's a lovely lesson to be teaching your child! For me it's been the opposite; my stepson has been guiding me towards being a more helpful person. Our bond is one I never thought I'd have, but now that he's in my life, I don't know what I'd do without him.""
B: ""That is so wonderfu. I treasure the relationship I have with my child. Although now that he is in high school I am no longer cool. ""
A: ""I'm sure once he leaves home, you'll be the first person he calls whenever he needs help or advice. I've been pleasantly surprised by how wonderful the majority of high-shcoolers are; they certainly don't deserve the bad reputation that so many teenagers are stuck with.""
B: ""They do get a bad rap at times, but it is not their fault. You cannot generalize everyone. ""

B: ""Cats are wonderful for that! What is your cat's name?""
A: ""My cat's name is Fish! Because he's the only cat I know who likes to be in water. DO you have any pets?""
B: ""haha!! That's a great name!!  I have 2 cats.  Paris and Wiggles are their names.  Paris loves water as well, which I thought was odd.  He likes to jump in the shower when the water is on!""
A: ""Oh wow! Does your son like your cats?""
B: ""He absolutely LOVES them!!  He spends alot of time with them.  He is particularly close with Wiggles.  They are best friends.  Does your son get along with your cat?""
A: ""He didn't like Fish at first but Fish has grown on him. Now he volunteers at an animal shelter""
B: ""That's wonderful!!! I have tried to encourage my son to volunteer.  He plays on the varsity soccer team, so he gets busy often.  Does he enjoy the shelter?""
A: ""He said it's very rewarding but sometimes sad to see all those mistreated pets. It's great that your son plays soccer! Do you like any sports?""

A: ""I'd really like to but I have some weak ankles. Any tips to get started?""
B: ""Yes, you should see a podiatrist/foot doctor before you start. They can give you insoles for your shoes that adjust the way you step to make your ankles stronger. After that, look online for something like couch to 5K. It starts you out very slowly so you don't wear yourself out too early.""
A: ""Oh ok! Thank you for the tips. I kind of thought I may need to see a doctor but to be honest I was trying to avoid it.""
B: ""I know, it's a pain to go to the doctor. I had to get insoles myself because I have a really high arch and get plantar fasciitis. Once you go though you'll scold yourself for not doing it sooner, I did!""
A: ""That gives me hope! I really think I have a case of plantar fasciitis myself. Sometimes its so hard to get up and get moving.""
B: ""Oh, especially with plantar fasciitis! the insoles will definitely help. Also you can stretch your toes back toward you for a while before you get out of bed in the morning and that helps.""
A: ""I will see the doctor definitely as you suggest.""
B: ""I am glad you are. Plantar Fasciitis is no joke, it can really be painful and should be looked at so you can get the help you need. ""
A: ""What is that? I don't think I have ever heard of it?""

B: ""Right?! It's the best! I've never been to a Florida panhandle beach before. Actually the only beach I think I've ever been on in Florida was in Miami. It was beautiful though. I want to plan a trip to FL for next March. Swimming with the manatees is a dream of mine. Have you ever done that?""

She is too young to have to hear about family budget issues.""
B: ""We are going to try to take some time off from cats for a bit after...well, you know. Nature takes its course. Vet bills for older cats are expensive since they need to go more often and need more testing. We're considering getting a puppy. Our two dogs now are rescues, but I had a Basset Hound that I raised from puppyhood til she died at 15, and I'm finally at the point where I can handle having another. I think it's a good idea to not let your daughter know about the money issues. Kids can really internalize stuff like that as being ""their fault"" somehow.""
A: ""Yeah I can imagine it gets hard when they get old. A puppy might be a nice change of pace! We've been thinking about getting a kitten for our daughter now that life is more balanced out.  And I agree,  kids don't need to reach adulthood too early.""
B: ""Kittens are great. I think they're actually better for kids than puppies sometimes because kittens will be more companionate and they're easier to care for - no walking!""
A: ""Oh definitely! They're also more self sufficient,  so we don't need to constantly provide a kitten with attention.""
B: ""Yes. And may I suggest, if you get two, it's not that much more expensive than one once shots are over with, and if the family is out for the day or on a weekend trip they can keep each other company.""
A: ""That sounds smart. I've heard that cats do prefer to live together as bonded pairs, so once I choose which doctor's office I'm going to join and find my salary, we may look into getting two. It is. weird being an out of work doctor, but it does mean that once I get a job back we'll have more than enough money. My wife is making enough right now as a professor, but I want us to be financially comfortable.""

B: ""Completely understandable. No worries! Have you been looking for a pet for your family?""

A: ""I'm at the headquarters in the city now. Got my own company vehicle and an office with windows that overlook the river! That's great that your kids are eager to learn. That must make teaching them SO much easier! I'm thinking about Spanish...I could definitely use that while communicating with employees in the locations I manage. Is it a difficult language to learn? Do you think those audio-type lessons are any good?""
B: ""Wow, it sounds like you are doing really well! As far as learning a language goes, the most effective way to do is to immerse yourself into the language. The best way is to spend some time in the country where the language is spoken. Don't be afraid to test out your skills with the locals.""

A: ""I should really take the leap one day and just sign myself up to lessons, because it would be such an achievement for me. I work a lot though, so I'd have to try and find time when I'm not in the office to learn Spanish. How do you find the time with being a school teacher? That must be a demanding job. ""
B: ""Well I did already have a little background from high school Spanish classes. But I actually learned most of it just from language apps, and spent a lot of time watching spanish TV.""

A: ""Yes, I want to know a fair amount of Spanish before traveling to Spain. ""
B: ""I forget what it's called, but you can also use an app that connects you with native speakers to learn the language in a video call.""
A: ""Oh wow, I will have to research that! I feel like you can learn so much quicker from an actual person! What do you find the key is to learning different languages. ""
B: ""Using the language frequently is my best advice.  If you hear people speaking Spanish, try to ask them questions or make conversation in the language.  Immersion is the quickest way to learn.  Or just move to Spain!""
A: ""Moving to Spain may be difficult, but I understand what you are saying! I will try to immerse myself. Does your boyfriend speak different languages as well? ""

A: ""Not anytime soon. I travel so much for work I wouldn't have enough time to spend with them. I am thinking of fostering an animal though. That way I can get to experience having a pet without all the commitment.""
B: ""Oh, that's a great way to get involved. Dog, cat, or something else?""
A: ""Either one honestly. I love both! Maybe some cats at first. ""
B: ""That's a good idea. Cats are lower maintenance than dogs. They're not maintenance-free, but at least you don't have to walk a cat or potty train it.""
A: ""Yeah that is what I am thinking! What are your dogs names?""
B: ""One's named Peanut, and the other's named Butter.""
A: ""Which is your German Shepherd, Peanut or Butter? ""
B: ""Peanut! The basset hound is butter. I'm considering getting a cat and naming it Jelly, haha""
A: ""That would be funny lol. I just fostered a cat named Pickles. He was fun to have for a little while. Would your dogs do ok with a cat?""
B: ""I've heard you can train dogs to be friendly to cats and vice versa. Are you enjoying spending time with Pickles?""
A: ""I was sad to give him back when he got adopted out. I would like one pet to keep i think""
B: ""Do you think you could manage it with your work schedule?""
A: ""No not really but I heard about this pet sitting service in my area that would walk my dog and let them out to go to the bathroom and keep them company. Have you ever used a pet service like that before for your dogs?""
B: ""Actually my brother started one of those pet sitting services! I haven't used it but it seems reliable""
A: ""Well, that makes me feel good that you have heard of the service. I never even knew something like that was an option, I just knew I couldn't take my pet to my movie gigs.""
B: ""Do you have any interesting movie projects coming up? I love action movies""

B: ""On my first night I had a few Bentleys and some other cars such as Ferrari's. It was cool yet quite nerve wracking at the same time. Don't want to damage anything.""
A: ""Do you have to pay if you do damage or do they keep insurance for you?  I would be terrified!  I'd also be tempted to take it around the block and see how fast I could get those sports cars going!""

Are they super comfy after wearing them for a few days?""

A: ""Do you ever run any marathons?  I don't know how people can do that!  I wish I had that kind of stamina!  I always tell people, if you see me running, you should run too, because something is chasing us!""
A: ""Has your new job impacted your eating habits any? Do you find yourself reaching for processed foods instead of salads more often?""
B: ""Yeah, sometimes. I have to admit that my lifestyle's been going downhill. Sleep's also not great - I'm taking some melatonin every night to cope.""
A: ""Oh that's not great to hear! I'm sure taking a few naps in the day may help your sleeping pattern. Do you work at night?""
B: ""I do now. My new job as a valet at the casino is a night shift. It's not great for my lifestyle, but the tips are great. All these late-night gamblers drive expensive European cars. Speaking of which, what sports car do you fancy?""
A: ""Wow, night shifts can certainly be challenging to get your head around, it can really affect your body with the change of sleeping pattern, so I can completely understand your struggles. Oh wow, I'd love to drive a Lambo aventador, that would be the dream. Just to see how fast I can go, see how much I can push the car to it's limits. ""

B: ""I've seen a Rolls-Royce, a few lambos, and this custom Bugatti they guy told me he bought with his winnings from roulette from this very casino! I bet the owners of this place are fuming every single time they see this guy drive in again with his flashy car. I wonder why he's not banned yet!""
A: ""That's insane mate! I would of loved to see that. He must of won a lot to buy that car. It must be so frustrating seeing people like that winning just from luck ""
B: ""Yeah, it is. Meanwhile I'm over here parking his car and sacrificing my sleep over it. Hey, at least the guy tips well. He tosses me a $50 every time he rolls around. I guess I can't complain about that!""
A: ""I can see how it can be but at least one day with all these big tips, you could maybe buy your own lambo or rolls royce. If people have money, and enough to gamble it, they're definitely going to tip well.""
B: ""That's something to hope for, certainly! I don't think I'd jump straight into buying an expensive car, though. I don't trust my driving skills enough. Ironic, I know.""
A: ""Is your sleep schedule getting any better? Do you get any nights off from your job? ""
B: ""No, I do not get any nights off from work but I am slowly starting to get into a better sleep schedule. Hopefully I will be rested enough soon to start running again.""
A: ""Yeah you will need some good rest to have energy for some running. Have you tried taking a nap yet?""
B: ""No, I woke up pretty refreshed today. I was thinking of heading to the beach to play volleyball for a while. Have you ever played beach volleyball?""
A: ""No I haven't I am not that athletic. You seem very athletic and outdoorsy. How many people play with you?""
B: ""There's usually a group of 6-8 people down there playing. I jump in when I can. It helps me wake up and get some sun. So besides cars, what else are you into?""
A: ""I like music and to read. Do you have a favorite music genre or ook?""
B: ""I love music and reading! My music tastes are all over the place but my favorite is 90s hip hop. What about you?""

B: ""I am so jealous! I love going to Disney World. What do you plan on doing while you are there?""
A: ""Im looking forward to the rides and maybe seeing Olaf.  Its been forever since I have been.  What do you recommend?""
B: ""I would definitely recommend seeing Olaf. He acts really goofy when you met him. The bummer cars are my favorite. I ran into my dad once and he almost fell out of the car! Don't go on the rollercoasters. They are too scary.""
A: ""I am going to book a character dining experience  they have one with Olaf!  It sounds like fun.  This way I dont have to wait in a line to see him he will come to the table.""
B: ""Yes! You should do that. Maybe Olaf will be your waiter. While you are there, would you mind giving Mickey a poem I wrote for him? I think he would like it.""
A: ""I would love to!  I'm planning on meeting as many characters as I can.  I'm picking up an autograph book for the trip.  I'll make sure to get a picture of him getting your poem.""
B: ""That is so nice so you! Get as many autographs as you can. I would love to get a copy of the picture with Mickey holding my poem. I would keep it forever and ever.""
A: ""I can't wait to go!  I hope its not busy.  School should be in so it should be that bad.  I hear the wait times can get long when they are busy.""
B: ""I hate it when it is busy. That is my least favorite part of Disney World. I had to wait an hour once to just get on one ride. It is not fair that they make us wait so long. They should let kids like me go right to the front of the line.""
A: ""I hear they have a fast pass system th you can use, but yea waiting is the worst part.  I had a friend wait over 2 hours for the peter pan ride, so I might skip that one.""
B: ""That ride is a little too scary for me. It has too many pirates. I've never used the fast pass system but I will make my dad get it the next we are there.""
A: ""When is Steelers next game take place? Do you plan to go there?""
B: ""They play this fall coming up. I’m really excited after seeing the schedule come out. I think they play the Packers In Green Bay this year!""
A: ""That's cool! How about Disney World? Do you think you'll go again this summer?""
B: ""I think me and my family are going to go again. I can’t wait to go on the rides. Did you tell my mom about the promotion you found for Disney World?""
A: ""Yeah, I spoke to her last night! She seemed pretty grateful, so maybe you will get to go! Have you met Elsa there yet?""
B: ""Yes and it was a lot of fun. I will try to get a picture with Olaf for you too!""
A: ""Aww, that's sweet! I can't wait to see it. You get her autograph too?""
B: ""No just a picture. But it’s in my bedroom and I look at it nearly every day. Are you still going to Disney World this summer? Maybe we will go at the same time!""
A: ""I am! Maybe we will, the promotion is only for specific dates so it's likely! You ever get those Mickey Mouse ears when you're there? I did but I lost mine.""
B: ""I had them the first time we went but I lost mine also so my mom won’t let me get another pair unless I help around the house. ""
A: ""Aww. You going to do that then?""
B: ""Yeah plus I like helping. My mom says I’m good at it. ""

A: ""It was a Dobermann and a tabby cat.  The artist really captured the beauty of the animals. They were sitting next to each other and the Dobermann was looking sternly at the tabby.""
B: ""Wow, that sounds like a phenomenal painting just from your description. I wonder if it's for sale. I'd totally buy it if I could afford it. ""
A: ""I don't think the owner would sell it.  I seen it in a local pet shop while shopping for more treats for my cats.  The owner said her son painted it.""
B: ""Oh, that's sweet! I'd definitely want the painting to stay there, then. By the way, don't you have cats at home? What are their names?""
A: ""The boy is Socks because he's all black except his paws are white.  The girl is Sassy because she seems to always have something to say and tries to get her way all the time.""
